		<h1><strong>Paul Dooley</strong></h1>
<h2><em>“Bass-hand-wise I’m trying to leave as much in the background as
 possible. I try not to draw too much attention to it. Some harp players
 have very inventive and very intricate bass hands. I find that can 
distract from the tune. Well from a traditional music standpoint, the 
tune is sacred so anything that camouflages the tune is… trouble, for me
 anyway. But I suppose that’s just a question of approach.”<br>
– Paul Dooley</em></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-152" src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/Paul-Rough-Edits.html" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></p>
<h2><strong>Words &amp; images: &nbsp;Mícheál Ó Catháin</strong></h2>
<h1><span style="font-size: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.4;">Paul Dooley’s 
recording Rip the Calico – traditional Irish dance music and slow airs 
played on an early Irish harp – struck a chord in me when I first 
listened to the tape cassette as a teenager in the 1990s. The bell-like 
notes immediately settled comfortably in my ears, echoing all the 
richness of traditional Irish music I had heard till then while also 
surprising and delighting me with something more fundamental – a sound 
or resonance which I hadn’t realised had been missing. My fascination 
with the early Irish harp grew from that experience.</span></h1>

<p>In this conversation<br>
1. Paul Dooley plays the Jointure &amp; Jigg, and shares how he went 
about his arrangement. This piece is arranged and played by each artist 
in this <em>early Irish harp: the State of the Art</em> series, providing a rich and comparable showcase of each of their individual styles.<br>
2. Paul illustrates a similar approach or style which he applies to many other pieces, especially Irish reels and jigs.<br>
3. Paul’s musical journey and how he first arrived at the wire-strung or early Irish harp<br>
4. Harp-making<br>
5. How to choose a harp<br>
6. Tuning for traditional music sessions<br>
7. Practice<br>

<h2><strong>JOINTURE &amp; JIGG</strong></h2>
<p><strong> Mícheál Ó Catháin: </strong><br>
<strong> Can we start by talking about the Jointure – it will be good to
 use it as an example, taking a few techniques and talking about the 
bass and treble hands, and ornamentation as well perhaps. From speaking 
earlier it’s an interesting piece as it’s a slow tune followed by a jig.
 </strong></p>
<p>Paul Dooley:<br>
Well traditional Irish dance music on the harp is my thing really. 
That’s the reason I started playing the harp in the first place. I heard
 Alan Stivell play jigs in the 70s and that’s what I’ve wanted to do 
ever since. I wasn’t really interested in the old harpers and all that 
kind of stuff… 17th century and 18th century, medieval and what have 
you. As I went on I discovered more about it and then I became 
interested. But in my younger days jigs and reels was all I was after 
really! So it was interesting to discover that jigs were played on the 
harp for as long as they’ve existed – jigs that is not harps. Now they 
probably didn’t play them exactly in the same way we are playing them 
today, more stately maybe, but this one seems to fit the bill pretty 
well. It was taken from O’Hampsey by Bunting [based on where it sits in 
MS4.29] so it was played with nails on a harp with metal strings.</p>
<p><strong> We were talking about this piece appearing in the 1724 Neal collection as well. </strong><br>
Well it’s interesting because there’s at least three versions of the 
Jointure and Jigg going. There is the one published by Bunting in 1796 
[in E] and the one in the manuscript that he got from O’Hampsey – ever 
so slightly different from the published version [in G], and there is 
the one in the Neal collection [in F]. The slow tune in the Neal version
 is also different, not quite the same as what Bunting has.&nbsp;So 
you’d wonder is that down to actual mistakes or were the harpers and 
musicians at the time of Neal and O’Hampsey a bit loose about how they 
played the tunes, or both. It was composed by Thomas Connellan (d. 1698)
 sometime in the late 1600s and it was still on the go a hundred years 
later, when O’Hampsey played it for Bunting, so it might well have 
changed along the way a bit. Anyway, the version I learned is the one 
from Bunting’s manuscript 29.</p>
<p><strong>If you could play it through that’d be great! And as you’re 
tuning Paul could you talk us through the approach you have to tuning 
the harp for this piece?</strong><br>
I use a few different approaches. One of them is to use an electronic 
tuner and sometimes that works well but more times it doesn’t. It’s 
important to understand that things are never fully in tune anyway for a
 start! On the metal-strung harp everything rings on and the harmonics 
are very strong, so if you don’t use the tuner you’ll tend to gravitate 
towards ‘just’ intonation, or if you tuned only in fifths it would be 
Pythagorean tuning.</p>
<p><strong>Are there two comhluí G’s on this harp?</strong><br>
No, when started playing I wasn’t aware of the ‘sister strings’ tuning, 
or the left shoulder thing either. When I did find out about it, it was 
too late to change. Neither of those things make any real difference to 
what you can and can’t play on a harp and after playing for years with 
one set up the readjustment would be huge, for me anyway.</p>
<p><strong>What is your first note to start tuning?</strong><br>
That all depends. I’d suspect that compared to what my equal-tempered 
electronic tuner says, the A here is going to be slightly sharp to the 
D, and the F [sharp] is a good bit flat. But that’s how it sounds good, 
so away you go from there! If I was using the electronic tuner the 
tuning wouldn’t be quite like this. But the harp can go out of tune 
quite a bit anyway, especially if it gets very cold or hot very quickly.
 The harp doesn’t like sudden changes in temperature or humidity. It 
will stay perfectly stable if the temperature or humidity doesn’t 
change. It tends to tighten up with increased humidity and go sharp, and
 flatten with heat. So if you get a hot humid day or a cold dry day it 
doesn’t know where it’s going!</p>
<p><strong>Is tuning by fifths is your approach generally?</strong><br>
Well I tune certain fifths to be pure, or stable I should say. For 
example, this tune will have the fifth from D to A in it, so that I’ll 
tune that pretty good. And since there is a lot of D in this piece, the 
F-sharps are going to be a bit flat, to give a sweet major third from 
the D. And then the B’s are going have to be flat to make the B-F-sharp 
fifths, because the F-sharps are flat, and so on. But depending on what 
tune you’re going to play that doesn’t necessarily work, but for the 
Jointure [in D] it does, it kinda does anyway!</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for talking through your tuning. That sets us nicely to hear you playing the Jointure and Jigg!</strong><br>

class="mce_SELRES_start"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;</iframe></p>
<p><strong>That’s quite a piece, there is a lot in it. Could you explain your approach to arranging the Jointure?</strong><br>
Well the melody is as it is and …[music]… except for there I put in …[music]… where I put in that F …[music]… and again, there.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/293676072.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0">=&amp;#8221;allowfullscreen&amp;#8221;&amp;gt;&lt;span
 data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; 
overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" 
class="mce_SELRES_start"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;</iframe><br>
And instead of …[music] … I’ve added the chord there – B with the D 
…[music]. Of course the Jointure is written in G, but I’m playing it in D
 here, lower than this, So all that …[music].</p>
<p>So the bass hand just goes down …[music]… in the opposite direction 
to the treble …[music]… and so I kinda do this is climb up …[music]. 
Then …[music]… now those little cuts or mordents – I don’t know what 
they’re called – there is just an X [or a cross rather] over the note in
 the in the manuscript. So sometimes I put them in, more times I don’t 
…[music]. I’m just assuming that that’s what they mean, but there’s 
really no indication of what they should be. So the first part again 
…[music].</p>
<p>And then the second part. The second part has two bass notes in it, 
which is unusual. There is a very great shortage of bass notes in the 
Bunting manuscripts as everyone knows! (laughing). But there are two 
…[music]… I think it is the B and the A there are written in the 
manuscript – I can’t remember now – I wove them in now to the 
arrangement so I forget which is which …[music]. So those little notes 
…[music]… they are all grouped together in the manuscript so they just 
fall in like that …[music].</p>
<p>So that’s the approach I used to arrange this piece. It’s not really 
an arrangement, more like a style. I learned how to do one tune like 
that at the beginning and I’ve done them all more or less like that 
since. It’s a method, for better or worse. At the time I started playing
 the harp I read an article in Ceol magazine by Gráinne Yeats where she 
talked about a fragment of a book, from 1742 I think – it’s in the 
National Library. It had compositions of O’Carolan with a bass line and 
his son was involved in the publication. She said that the bass line 
moved in single notes that it didn’t seem to make much sense according 
to conventional harmony. So I thought that’s a great idea – just move in
 single notes. Then I started trying that and it was a bit “thin”! So I 
thought maybe I would move in octaves instead. The piece I was working 
on at the time was the hornpipe The Rights of Man.</p>
<p><strong>Can you give an example of the single note method and then the octave method?</strong><br>
So the single note method on the Rights of Man is …[music]… then in octaves …[music]…<br>

Now I don’t play everything exactly like that anymore but that’s more or
 less how it started. And then doing the damping in places where you 
can’t damp legato you end up with a nice sort of syncopated rhythm, and I
 just left that alone.</p>
<p><strong>It would be really nice to talk about the Jigg section of 
this as well, because you have a unique angle on playing jigs on the 
harp, having played so much Irish dance music over the years on the 
fiddle as well.</strong><br>
For the Jigg …[music]… that’s as it’s written.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/293676403.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
And the ornaments there …[music]… sometimes I do the two of them, 
sometimes not. [Music]… that’s what’s written but then I tend to put a B
 roll in …[music]. So, the plain version is …[music]… with the roll then
 …[music]… and then the second part …[music]… so the same thing again, 
{after playing a plain version}, I tend to put rolls in …[music]… I 
don’t put them everywhere, but I pick and choose my moments. [music].</p>
<p><strong>The bass hand in the Jigg is a very natural sound. &nbsp;It doesn’t sound contrived</strong><br>
Like what you’d expect almost?! It’s not very different from Bunting’s 
arrangement I think. I remember putting it on the computer and playing 
that back and thinking “right okay, I’m there or thereabouts”. Sometimes
 his arrangements are a bit… I wouldn’t like them. Other times there’s 
just too many accidentals in there so I just couldn’t attempt them.</p>
<p><strong>You mean the published version of the Jointure and Jigg is not that different to the manuscript?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, well the actual melody is the same as the manuscript, for the 
jig anyway. But what I meant was his added bass in the printed 
publication is not a million miles away from what I’m doing there, or it
 has a very similar feel at least – they are probably quite different in
 reality.</p>
<p><strong>Would you take a similar approach to most jigs, in how you play your bass hand?</strong><br>
In the jig what I used was very simple …[music]… so I use much the same 
in ordinary, or everyday jigs. This is one I composed actually, called 
the Harper’s Fancy or the Millenium Jig …[music].<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/293676583.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
Bass-hand-wise I’m trying to leave as much in the background as 
possible. I try not to draw too much attention to it. Some harp players 
have very inventive and very intricate bass hands. I find that can 
distract from the tune. Well from a traditional music standpoint, the 
tune is sacred so anything that camouflages the tune is… trouble, for me
 anyway. But I suppose that’s just a question of approach. I mean to 
someone outside the tradition, it could be that the more excitement or 
entertainment value there is in the bass-hand the better. It depends on 
your point of view.</p>
<p><strong>Do you see that there’s any particular differences in playing
 the neo-Irish or nylon-strung lever harp in the bass hand, versus the 
early Irish or wire-strung harp?</strong></p>
<p>Well, as dance music is played more and more on harps, players of the
 ‘neo-Irish’ harp have developed a whole new way of playing the bass. 
They do a lot of damping – every bit as much as we would do on metal 
strings. But their strings are not as close together and that wider 
spacing can allow for very interesting bass-hand accompaniment. As well 
as that, the neo-Irish harps have a much more powerful sound. There’s 
more of a kind of boom sound from the lower strings so it can make for a
 very active…&nbsp;oumphy…&nbsp;bass line. This could be quite good if 
you’re playing in a big session, playing with melody instruments that 
are also carrying the tune. The heavy bass may be too strong for your 
own melody line, but if you are playing with other melody instruments as
 well, then that is counterbalanced. In that case the bass doesn’t 
obscure the tune anymore – other people are loud enough – so that 
overall the balance between the melody and bass is at the right level.</p>
<h2><strong>ARRIVING AT THE HARP</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Paul I’d love if you could you talk about your own musical journey, how you arrived at the harp.</strong><br>
Or how did the harp arrive at me! Well, growing up in Canada I used to 
play the guitar, I used to like rock and roll and all kinds of things. 
One time my father brought home a record of Alan Stivell playing the 
harp. It was his Renaissance of the Celtic harp and I was just blown 
away by the sound of it, and especially the sound of jigs played on the 
harp. I’ve just been fascinated by the harp ever since.</p>
<p><strong>How long did it take from the time you first heard that Alan Stivell record to when you began playing yourself?</strong><br>
Oh I was about 10 when that came out, my father actually made a harp 
around that time. He got a kit from a mail order place, in California I 
think, and he made the harp and we played with it for a bit. Then there 
was a loud bang in the middle of the night and the thing collapsed 
because it was under too much tension. It wasn’t a great design anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Was this a metal-strung harp?</strong><br>
No. Maybe it should have been metal-strung right enough. It had a type 
of nylon strings, like the bass strings on a classical guitar. It 
sounded quite nice for the time it lasted. Anyway so that was that. My 
brother played classical music on the guitar and he ended up learning 
the concert harp for a while. I didn’t do any music then for a few 
years. I left home as you do, and eventually found my way to Dublin. I 
always had in my mind that I’d like to make a harp, as I liked that 
sound. I would go to Trinity – it was free that time – you’d go into the
 Long Room where the book of Kells and the harp was. I’d be looking at 
it, the shape of it, fascinated. I realised that once your tuning pegs 
worked, your harp could be in tune and that whatever other flaws it 
might have, it would be playable. It wouldn’t be like a flute with a 
hole in the wrong place or a guitar with a fret in the wrong place – 
which could never work ever. You could make a harp that would work very 
easily, and quickly. So I made my first harp and got into it a bit more.
 I had the view to maybe try to make a living at making instruments but I
 found out very soon that it wasn’t going to be possible.</p>
<p><strong>Was this at a time when you were in Trinity as a student?</strong><br>
No no, I used to just go in as a tourist, at that time I was working in a restaurant in Dublin.</p>
<p><strong>And so had you made furniture or other instruments?</strong><br>
Not really no. You know, there were tools at home, and I’d make goal posts or a basketball stand or the like from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>So you’re naturally very good with your hands. Not everyone 
would feel that they could just pick&nbsp;up a set of tools and make a 
harp!</strong><br>
Well I had made a window and a couple of other things – I had basic 
skills, but nothing fancy. My first harp was a very crude affair. The 
soundbox was made of plywood and the frame was made out of four by two’s
 that were cut roughly in the shape of a harp. But it very quickly came 
under too much pressure and&nbsp;didn’t last very long. But it sounded 
great. I lived in a Georgian building that had lovely window surrounds –
 with shutters and a low platform. So I had the harp up on that and once
 it was sitting on that, there was a lovely bass sound­ – almost as if 
the whole window surround acted as a soundbox. To compensate for my poor
 plywood! Once you lifted it off the thing sounded really dull! But I 
managed to get Brian Ború’s March and a couple of other things out of 
it.</p>
<h2><strong>HARP-MAKING</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Was the harp design based on the Trinity harp?</strong><br>
Yeah, roughly. As much as you could by looking at the back of a ten 
pence or a fifty pence coin at the time – that was the biggest one there
 was!</p>
<p><strong>And even if you were able to get your hands on the original 
harp sitting in Trinity, that has got parts missing down around the 
bottom of the fore-pillar. </strong><br>
Yes that area is missing. The Trinity harp doesn’t sit quite right, but 
it’s not very wrong either as it turns out. I’ve done quite a bit of 
research on that a few years ago now.</p>
<p><strong>The dimensions of the fore-pillar impacts the length of the strings and maybe even the number of strings doesn’t it?</strong><br>
Well this is it. The first harp I made looked like the one on the back 
of the money just about. It sounded… just about okay! It had guitar 
strings all the way to top because I didn’t know where you’d get harp 
strings. I really didn’t know anything about harps at all – I mean the 
nearest I would have really been to a working harp would have been 
looking in the window in Waltons. These harps were very expensive. I 
didn’t really twig that their strings were coloured, or were gut. It 
didn’t occur to me because Alan Stivell’s harp definitely sounded like 
it had metal strings so I just assumed all small Irish harps had metal 
strings. I hadn’t really given the concert harp any thought at all.</p>
<p>So anyway, as I went on I discovered that it’s just not good enough 
to make a pretty curve here on the neck and a pretty curve there on the 
fore-pillar. That’s not how it works, there’s a lot more to it than 
that. I realised that the lengths of the strings have to relate to each 
other in a certain way because otherwise they might start breaking, or 
some of them would be too loose.</p>
<p><strong>Has this ratio of string lengths got to do with distributing the loading on the soundbox?</strong><br>
Not so much that. The ‘loading’ [the total amount of tension] comes from
 a different thing. It’s from the string gauges you use. If you replace a
 string with a thicker one, you’ll have to put a lot more tension on 
that thicker string to reach the same note. Because the strength of the 
string is proportional to the area of its cross-section – the bigger 
that is, the stronger the string – it would still break at the same note
 more or less, so it can reach the same pitch but it’s just not going to
 sound the same. It might even sound like it wants to go higher – even 
if that’s not possible – before it starts sounding right.</p>
<p><strong>Is this because it just has to vibrate at a given frequency?</strong><br>
Not quite, it’s because it won’t sound true – or not great – unless it’s
 tuned high enough. If it’s too low [loose] it makes harmonics that 
aren’t really in tune with other notes you might want to play. So the 
more taut the string is the more those harmonics are in tune. They’ll be
 still sharp but not quite as much. As you loosen the strings or as the 
metal is stiffer and harder – there’s a lots of variables – they’ll be 
sharper and sharper, so basically the string should be as taut as 
possible to get the best sound possible.</p>
<p><strong>So quite a narrow string could be the best could be the optimum?</strong><br>
Yes! It is counterintuitive. For instance, if your bass string isn’t 
working great, a thinner string [of the same material] will probably do a
 better job than a thicker one, whereas you would assume that it is the 
other way around. That’s because the thinner string is going to be more 
flexible.</p>
<p><strong>I would have thought that the thicker the strings, the longer your harp is going last but that’s not necessarily true is it?</strong><br>
It could be the opposite even if tension is the issue. The thicker 
string will just pull more, it will demand more tension to give you the 
same note.</p>
<p>Back to the design of the harp. It takes a bit of figuring out but 
basically by experiment you know that a string of a certain length will 
make you that note nicely, and if it is shorter than that it is not 
going to be as nice, whereas if it’s too long it’s going to break. From 
that, theoretically you can also work out what length each string on the
 harp needs to be with mathematical ratios. How they did it in the old 
days, I don’t know, but they did it! They worked out the lengths of 
strings to make a harp that was balanced properly, so that the strings 
wouldn’t break. It is not good enough to just copy a harp because it 
looks a certain way. You have to understand what drove the design in the
 first place. So to copy the one in Trinity exactly may not be the best 
thing to do because it is sitting with a load of resin here and there. 
Figuring out the original design needs a bit of work but as I said 
earlier, it so happens that it’s near enough.</p>
<p>My good friend Paddy Cafferky who makes fantastic gut-strung harps, 
answers that question most succinctly: how would you determine the shape
 of the harp? “Basically you get the strings and you build a harp around
 it.” That’s the easiest way to answer it.</p>
<p>In other words you decide what notes you want, you decide what 
lengths they need to be to sound nice, and you fit the harp around that.
 So if you get brass strings, you know if the string is the length of 
this table it’ll be such a note. It needs to be longer to be a note 
lower or shorter for a note higher. And just go from there, and 
depending on the kind of tensions your going for you’ll end up with 
something that looks like a Trinity or a Queen Mary harp or similar.</p>
<p><strong>In your own journey as a harp maker, was there anybody else 
making early Irish harps at that time you were starting out, or was it 
just out of necessity for your own playing that you began making harps?</strong><br>
Well for me it was out of necessity because I couldn’t possibly afford 
one of Walton’s harps, and they weren’t metal-strung anyway. There were 
other people making them I’m sure. Peter Kilroy in Kenmare would have 
been making harps, at the same time or even before that. Paul Doyle in 
Strokestown was making harps, also Michael Billinge in Cork. I don’t 
think anyone else in Ireland was making them then, I’m talking about 
metal-strung harps now and we’re talking pre-internet times here so 
there was no instant way of accessing anything like now. You would have 
to get the 07/09 phonebook to get the Roscommon harp maker’s number. You
 know, we forget how all that was back in the day! So I just plowed 
ahead and did my own thing anyway.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned Peter Kilroy. There was a documentary called Hands in which he featured, and a book following that.</strong><br>
Yes, that’s right. His harps were excellently made, I actually did the music for that documentary and played one of them.</p>
<p><strong>You also mentioned Michael Billinge. I remember seeing him, 
together with Seamus O’Kane, making a replica of the Downhill harp 
played by Nollaig Brolly, in a documentary made a few years ago called 
Banríon an Cheoil. I’m now realising his background goes quite a bit 
further?</strong><br>
Yes, Michael Billinge was in that documentary and made a beautiful 
replica of the Downhill with Séaus Ó’Kane. Michael had been researching 
and making harps for a long long time before that came out. Himself and 
Bonnie Shaljean have done a lot of work on the chromatic Irish harps. 
They published an article on that years ago. Paul Doyle was making harps
 back then too, and to this day he still makes bouzoukis, guitars and 
all sorts of instruments. His workshop is in Galway now on Dominic 
Street. The back of this harp in front of me here came from a piece of 
wood that was for the front of a cello and I bought that off Paul.</p>
<p><strong>You have made a number of Trinity models now. How many have you made?</strong><br>
The harp I’m playing here is a sort of augmented Trinity – it’s more or 
less like the Trinity plus four strings in the bass. The main idea of 
this particular design was to have the same range of notes as the 
[neo-Irish] harps you see in sessions [from bass C upwards], and the 
idea in a way was to compete with that. So this harp is probably more 
like the size of the Castle Otway harp than the Trinity harp. But I made
 a few Trinity’s over the years, and some recently, the one in the Irish
 Traditional Music Archive is the first willow one I made, back in 1984 
or 1985.</p>
<p><strong>Is there an approach to the selecting material for the metal 
strings themselves – is there a material that you consider the best, and
 you wouldn’t really change again?</strong><br>
No, I couldn’t really say that because the strings on my harp are all 
different. That’s because when you replace a broken string you get what 
you have at hand – could be someone else’s spare strings – and the 
chances are that’s going to be different from what was on the harp when 
it was made first. So some metals can be interchangeable and I couldn’t 
say one’s better than another. As I said it all depends what note you 
need to get from what length of string.</p>
<p>But there are differences in copper alloys, phosphor bronze [and 
similarly with historical bronzes] is a great material because it can 
get very hard and makes very nice crispy higher notes. Yellow brass is 
similar that way. Different grades of brass like red brass or gilding 
metal are that bit softer and when it gets near the high strings not 
quite as bright or as strong. With the higher notes red brass doesn’t 
carry that well, but it has a very nice low to mid-range. The state of 
the metal also makes a big difference, the harder it is the stronger it 
is so the higher it can be tuned. This becomes important especially on 
harps that have lower strings are on the short side [low-headed harps].</p>
<p><strong>Have you a theory on how strings were made without modern techniques</strong><br>
Well the technique hasn’t changed really, some of the equipment has of 
course but the principles are the same. You just melt your metal and 
cast it into a rod first and then beat it up smaller and smaller until 
it gets thin enough – maybe 3mm or less – so you can pull it through a 
drawplate or a die or something like that. From there on you just pull 
it through smaller and smaller holes. Every time you hit the metal or as
 you work it, it gets harder so you have to anneal it regularly to stop 
small cracks and defects from forming during that process. But you also 
need to anneal it because with every pass it becomes physically harder 
to get it through the next hole in the drawplate [or the next die] and 
then it’s also harder on the tools. I’d imagine the tools would have 
been precious back then. So anyway when the wire gets to maybe 
1.5–1.2mm, you would anneal it for the last time. At that point the wire
 can be drawn small enough without causing defects.</p>
<p><strong>Thinking about the basics of drawing metal strings, why is 
the lower range likely to be that bit softer without the same number of 
annealing processes as the higher range?</strong><br>
In that sequence I described it would have the same amount of annealing,
 but the treble has more cold working, which hardens the metal. As it 
gets thinner and thinner you don’t have to anneal it anymore because the
 percentage of squeezing that goes on – or reduction – is still the same
 relatively speaking but there is much less metal getting squashed. Of 
course it’s possible to have the lower range drawn really hard as well. 
It would just mean the last annealing needs to take place earlier. But 
that also means you would have to draw separate coils for each gauge 
[the fully-hardened thick wire could not be drawn thinner without 
becoming brittle].</p>
<p><strong>What would you think of the idea of spiral cutting a string 
out of a sheet of metal? &nbsp;Ann Heymann experimented with wires made 
in this way with historical wire-smith Daniel Tokar.</strong><br>
Mmm, would it be viable for strings? Well it might be. I’m just thinking
 about how would you go about that. It would be very finicky, 
unnecessarily so I would say. Wire was made like that for jewellery in 
the early Middle Ages but I’d be surprised if you could make wire thin 
enough and reliable for treble strings [0.5-0.4mm]. Anyway, the 
drawplate predates the harps by at least a few hundred years so I 
imagine that it would have superseded that kind of method. And, 
regardless, the net effect of the cold working will be the same no 
matter what method is used. As time went on, when keyboard instruments 
became popular, you could get very fine [good quality] wire from 
England, France, Germany or wherever and it would be imported. There 
would be no need to make it in your back yard then.</p>
<p><strong>We probably underestimate how connected Ireland was with other parts of Europe right back to medieval times.</strong><br>
You have to remember this was a high class high art. There would have 
been be no expense spared. With the amount of work that went into 
decorating these harps, they would have been show pieces. If the guy 
wanted to get wire from abroad, that’s what would have happenned I 
imagine… if that was where wire was available at that stage.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think these harps would have been serious pieces of art just visually, as well as to be played?</strong><br>
Without all the decorations these harps would have sounded exactly the 
same. So the decorations, like on the Kildare harp, that was there to 
impress the neighbours.</p>
<p><strong>In a conversation I had with the late Tristram Robson some 
years ago, he explained his research into how the harp was played 
between 1550 and 1650 in the English Court. This was played by Irish 
harpers initially, with this Irish harp being adopted as a court 
instrument played by English musicians towards the latter part of that 
period. &nbsp;Tristram explained that it became more of a chromatic 
instrument (twelve notes in an octave) as it was adopted.</strong><br>
Yes and then the keyboard took over from it, which was much easier to 
play. There’s a quote from around that time from John Evelyn about his 
friend, a Mr Clarke, ‘… who makes it [the chromatic Irish harp] execute 
lute, viol, and all the harmony an instrument is capable of. Pity it is 
[Clarke said] that it is not more in use; but indeed, to play well takes
 up the whole man…’, meaning that if you were going to be learning a 
chromatic Irish harp you couldn’t do anything else really! There’s so 
many more mistakes on the harp if you have a chromatic scale, it would 
demand the person’s the whole attention. Things are bad enough on a 
diatonic [seven notes in an octave] harp! Apparently Mr Clarke had been 
playing since the age of five!</p>
<p><strong>We’re only touching on your harp making here. For someone 
reading this interview with a deeper interest in harp-making, is there a
 way for them to follow your work or connect with you?</strong><br>
Well some day I might get around to updating my website and put 
something on there, in the meantime I can always be contacted via email.</p>
<h2><strong>CHOOSING A HARP // TUNING FOR SESSIONS</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Can we talk about choosing a harp?</strong><br>
When choosing a harp you need to figure out first what kind of music it 
is you want to play on it. Then you need to get a harp that suits that 
music. If you get a nice small 22-string harp beginning at around tenor G
 in the bass [fiddle G] you’ll be able play very nice medieval music on 
it, and it’s going to be very portable. If that’s what you want to do 
then that’s the one to get. But it’ll be very frustrating if you want to
 branch into Irish dance music, because you would have a lot of high 
notes that are no good to you and you wouldn’t have the bass notes you 
need. Having said that, you could play all the tunes you want on 22 
strings, but they just wouldn’t be in the usual keys. If you wanted to 
play O’Carolan’s music for example you’d probably need to get a 
high-headed model that goes down quite low in the bass. It’s possible to
 play any kind of music on any harp but you’d want to satisfy yourself 
first that you’re going to have the right kind of scale and range of 
notes if you’re going to be playing with other people.</p>
<p><strong>So what do you say if students ask “I like the sound of the early Irish harp, where can I get one”?</strong><br>
I’d say take your time and shop around. Try it out first, go to 
festivals, hire one out if you can. Most importantly for anybody, buy 
one that’s already made and that you like the sound of.</p>
<p><strong>You took a deep interest in Irish dance music when very few 
playing the early Irish harp were doing that. Is it possible to play if 
you join in a session? That seems like a very difficult thing to do with
 a diatonically tuned harp.</strong><br>
It depends on the repertoire. In some fiddle sessions you just wouldn’t 
attempt it, because if they play in flat keys you could be in B-flat one
 minute and in A the next minute, that’s just not going to work out. It 
is difficult enough for a harp with a semitone system. If you play the 
piping repertoire, pretty much the standard repertoire, you would be 
there or thereabouts. When I used to play in sessions – I don’t do it 
quite as much now – I used to have the harp tuned in G, and I would just
 change the C to C-sharp [below the high D] if I needed to play in D, 
because I wouldn’t use the C’s in the bass in D. So I’d have all the 
‘keys’ [or modes rather] with one sharp A minor [Dorian], E minor 
[Aeolian], G major [Ionian], and D Mixolydian. Then with the one C-sharp
 I’d have B minor, D major etc., so by just changing one string you 
could have almost all the common keys. If there was a flute or whistle 
playing you would have all of those keys. More and more, it is not 
realistic to expect to be able to walk in to any session with a 
wire-strung harp and be able to play all the tunes with everybody. That 
doesn’t even work with a fiddle, unless you know thousands of tunes. So 
really, you need to pick your sessions. You have to know the repertoire,
 and who you are going to be playing with. If you go to the same session
 every week you end up learning all those tunes, and they’ll learn some 
of yours. That’s how it works.</p>
<p><strong>You have added a few strings onto&nbsp;this Trinity harp. Is that to allow you to play with other musicians?</strong><br>
The reason for those four extra strings was because they were on other 
lever harps. The bottom notes at the moment are F-sharp, D, and B. It 
was to give the same bass range, so I could play the same arrangements 
as other harps. As it turns out I never did, they are very seldom used. 
F-sharp is the lowest I go usually. For effect now and again I’ll use 
the big bass B.</p>
<p><strong>For someone interested in playing dance music&nbsp;on the 
early Irish harp&nbsp;together with other musicians, would you recommend
 these additional strings?</strong><br>
You wouldn’t really need those four strings. But you need to have at 
least an octave below the D to make some sort of a bass line – otherwise
 you have to climb over your melody line too much. I think of it like 
this – the treble range is like a tin whistle and the bass range is like
 a guitar. So you don’t want the two to be on top of each other, at 
least I find that awkward. But I suppose if you learn like this 
[combining accompaniment and melody in the same range] to begin with it 
is no problem.</p>
<h2><strong>PRACTICE</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Do you have a particular approach to practice, say the speed 
at which you learn a new tune? You do you seem to play at incredible 
speeds very accurately. In a few concerts I have seen you go from a slow
 piece to a fast reel – it is extraordinary to see the dexterity. I’m 
wondering how you go from that phase of learning a piece, to then 
bringing it up to your performance speed.</strong><br>
Well if I’m learning a reel I wouldn’t practice at full tilt. Usually I 
have the tune in my head already, and that’s a problem on the harp 
because you could play the harp with one finger and all the notes would 
sound fine. The question is to hit the right note. So the more the 
jumping from one note to another without placing your fingers in advance
 the more chance you will hit the wrong one. So my approach is not 
necessarily to actually place fingers on the strings and then play. If 
you were going to play a reel that wouldn’t work. Instead I sort of walk
 my fingers on the harp, with certain fingering shapes trained into my 
hand.</p>
<p>Ideally when you’re learning the harp you should learn tunes in 
blocks of fingering rather than chunks of melody. Sometimes it doesn’t 
make much sense at first to hear a block of four notes in a row, 
followed by another four, followed by three. But then when it does come 
together it’s not going to falter. As regards the speed, when I started 
playing the harp I took that on as a bit of a challenge, because at the 
time people thought dance music couldn’t be played on the harp at the 
proper [dancing] speed. So I probably overdid it in challenging myself 
to play very fast. It’s not necessarily nicer when it’s faster. You can 
play slow reels and they’re just fine as pieces of music – they can be 
very nice.</p>
<p><strong>I think of how pipers learn tunes. At the Willy Clancy summer
 school for example, young pipers are invited each year to perform 
during the lunchtime concerts, and they will often play a slow reel into
 a hornpipe. And you hear them then a year or two later and they are 
playing at the speed of Patsy Tuohy – just amazing. Clearly they learn 
their techniques at quite a leisurely speed and then all that technique 
remains in place and there is perfectly tight playing at much higher 
speeds.</strong><br>
Well that’s exactly what you need to do on the harp. You need to learn 
those blocks of notes. Except that when you learn one ornament on the 
harp it fits anywhere, whereas on the pipes when you learn an “A-C-A” 
triplet for example, that’s where it is on the chanter all the time.</p>
<p>So yeah, if you were starting off now that’s what I’d recommend you 
should do, but it’s not necessarily what I do! There is a danger of 
playing it “any way at all”. I guess the best thing to do is to play the
 tune off the top of your head for a while first and find out where it 
breaks down and then isolate those places that you need to do something 
about and sort out the fingering. Otherwise you may get away with it for
 so long – you might get it right half the time or two thirds of the 
time – but when it matters you might not! So the longer you leave it 
before you do something about it, the harder it is to correct. It can 
become a bad habit very quickly. So it’s good to get into good habits 
from the beginning. But unfortunately when I started learning I was 
doing my own thing and I had no idea where it was going!</p>
<p><strong>This is why it is exciting that the early Irish harp is 
becoming more common as an instrument and it’s possible for the likes of
 myself to avoid reinventing the wheel.</strong><br>
Hopefully everyone adds a little bit to the pot and then in a few 
generations people will just play it at the same level as the pipes are 
being played today. That would be fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>Can you give an example of breaking a tune down into blocks of notes?</strong><br>
Ok say for a reel like Miss Lyons. How would I follow my own advice, practicing in blocks of fingering?<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/293676719.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
This kind of pattern, the idea is to learn it in blocks …[music]… and 
then …[music]. So you would basically play …[music]… now that becomes 
quick because you know exactly where the notes are. You have four in a 
row there, so you keep your hand in that position …[music]. It flows 
better that way …[music].</p>
<p>So the second part then …[music]… you have all these root position 
things which are really easy to handle with with two or three fingers 
there …[music]… so those four notes together …[music]… and back to 
…[music]… that’s all root position stuff. Then the same thing …[music]… 
then that position there with thumb, gap, two fingers, gap, and four 
…[music]… so that gets you out of trouble going down that run of notes 
…[music]. The whole part then …[music].</p>
<p>Given the harp has such a long sustain, you don’t seem to let the 
bass hand strings ring out for very long. You seem to damp them quite 
quickly.<br>
Well sometimes I will let it go …[music].<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/293676855.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>In the bass hand, is it a one- two-chord kind of a thing you are playing?</strong><br>
As with the Rights of Man it is basically one note in theory, so you’d have two D’s …[music].<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/293677028.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
If there is going to another note it’s going to be the A in between …[music]. And very<br>
seldom is it going to be …[music]… any combination of that (a full D triad). But sometimes I’ll have …[music].</p>
<p><strong>What is that chord in the second half?</strong><br>
So that’s A-A and then E …[music]. It’s just reiteration of the same octave or the fifth in between.</p>
<h2><strong>ORNAMENTATION FOR DANCE TUNES</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Can you explain your approach to ornamentation for reels and other dance tunes?</strong><br>
A lot of the minor tunes [as we call them] are based on two adjacent 
triads. In other words these tunes often go forward and backwards 
between two triads – for example, between A-minor and G-major triads – 
in various fingering patterns.</p>
<p>And then in terms of our ornamentation what comes up very often is 
…[music]. This is a sort of imitation of a roll on the flute …[music].<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/293829926.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
So what you’re playing really is three B’s …[music]… barely playing the A underneath to make it sound like it’s a roll …[music].</p>
<p>If you hit the lower note really loud …[music]… the ornamentation becomes more like an<br>
accordion triplet …[music]. So it’s kind of forgiving as an ornament 
because it’ll give you give you different shades of different effects 
depending on how well you execute the one you mean to, or not!</p>
<p>Then it’s the same fingering for a full triplet …[music]. So for the 
same fingering pattern you get three different ornaments, or even more 
if you end up hitting the bottom string first …[music]. That works 
sometimes, for some things. Yeah so that’s really long and short of the<br>
ornamentation I use in dance music – various incarnations of that triplet.</p>
<p><strong>It sounded like the reel Toss the Feathers at one point 
there. Is this a tune you ornament in this way, with triplets, or 
“flute” and “accordion” rolls?</strong><br>
Yeah, so I’d play it along these lines …[music].<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/293677152.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
So you have nice simple chords there – a basic E, and a basic D 
…[music]. It starts off …[music]… so that pattern there with the B roll 
off the E first, and then off the high D …[music]. You could do a roll 
on the bottom …[music]. To make it crispier you could do a triplet on 
the E …[music]. Then a change of chord …[music]… then your familiar 
gapped scale with the your fourth finger …[music].</p>
<p>Then in the second part you could start …[music]… depending on what 
instruments you want to emulate. On the fiddle you would have no option 
to roll on the E there of course. So you would have to go …[music]. But a
 flute would probably do …[music]… and you can do …[music]. Would you do
 all those rolls? You wouldn’t. You would put gaps in it rather than 
roll roll roll everywhere in it. Once you know where they are you can 
just change them around every time through a part …[music].</p>
<p><strong>As you play ornaments in a “flute style” there, it is almost 
like you are allowing a gap for an imaginary breath. Is this 
intentional?</strong><br>
Well in theory you could play triplets and notes everywhere on the harp,
 because you don’t have to breathe, but it just doesn’t sound natural if
 you fill in all the gaps all the time. So you have to pick and choose 
where you do it …[music]… that kind of thing.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/293677433.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
If you do in different places next time round the tune, it kinda makes 
it interesting for the listener as well. Because you are playing the 
same tune but you aren’t playing the gaps in exactly the same places.</p>
<h2><strong>ROBERT AP HUW MANUSCRIPT</strong></h2>
<p><strong>In discussing the Jointure &amp; Jigg early we touched on 
both the Bunting manuscripts and the Neal collection. Could we talk 
about another manuscript you are very familiar with – the Robert ap Huw 
manuscript? I have a basic understanding of the significance of the 
manuscript and I’d love to understand some of your deep insights into 
what this manuscript of early Welsh harp music tells us about our Irish 
equivalent.</strong></p>
<p>Well for starters, there are not many people who actually play from 
the Ap Huw manuscript. There’s been a few different interpretations of 
it going over the years. But the way I play it comes from the work of 
Peter Greenhill, who wrote a monumental series of dissertations on it. 
This takes account of all the latest research into the manuscript and 
his interpretation is quite simple in the end but the crucial thing is 
that it’s consistent, and it works everywhere.</p>
<p>As to the significance of it, it was copied in 1613 by Robert ap Huw 
from earlier stuff. There were two or three different sources [maybe 
more], it’s not all from one source. The tablature it’s written in 
probably originates from at least 1550 or earlier. The composers that 
are named in the manuscript can be dated from 1350 to 1480. But there 
are lists of pieces for which there is no music, but that existed, and 
the composers of some of those pieces and people who had pieces named 
after them go back to 1320 and earlier. For instance, one is a lament 
for William of Scotland (d. 1214). You can easily go back to the 1100s 
with other titles. So some of it is probably very old. You could argue 
that some of these pieces could have been written in honour of the same 
people in the 1500s but that seems unlikely.</p>
<p>The most important thing about the manuscript is that it has all the 
chords, all the lower hand and upper hand are all written there in black
 on white. So we know exactly what they did with their bass hand, 
whereas with the Irish stuff we’re only guessing. And then as well as 
that the fingering for the upper hand is explained in great detail – 
what finger played a note, and what finger they damped with. There’s a 
list of two-, three-, and four-note finger movements on page 35 of the 
manuscript that explains all that. Usually the first note of a movement 
is damped. So it stands to reason that the accent is on the second note,
 and usually the chord that goes with it will harmonise with that 
accented note. So by extension we know the timing of a whole piece.</p>
<p>So in the Ap Huw manuscript we have music that is older than 
O’Carolan for sure and possibly as old as what Giraldus Cambrensis 
[Gerald of Wales] heard when he came to Ireland, the music he raved 
about in his writings. Very likely as old as that, or certainly the 
style would be, so “important” really doesn’t begin to describe it!</p>
<p>That said, as far as technique for playing the 17th and 18th century 
music goes, it is not really that useful. It’s really a separate body of
 music, but its harmony operates on the same kind of principles as 
traditional music still does.</p>
<p><strong>I have heard the Ap Huw harmony referred to as a double tonic
 or home and way. And that the notation looks a like binary computer 
code! Can you shed some light on this?</strong><br>
So the music follows a system of measures and each measure is notated in
 ones or zeros, and the ones and zeros correspond to, we’ll say, 
contrasting chords. So a basic example of that would be for Brian Ború’s
 march. Let’s say if that was a one …[music]… and that was a zero 
…[music]… so you could have …[music].<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/293678641.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
So that pattern is 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 …[music]. Then the second part 
…[music]… third part …[music]. So in that same way the Welsh pieces 
followed the chord pattern that could be notated in ones and zeros like 
that. But the measures were much longer than that, some of them.</p>
<p>This pattern is an officially named measure called Mak y Mwn Byr, 
which we could translate loosely as “the short measure of Munster” or 
“the men of Munster”. Funnily enough Brian Ború was King of Munster.</p>
<p><strong>So that’s an example of one measure in the Ap Huw manuscript. How many other measures are there?</strong><br>
There are 24 of these measures in the official canon, and each has a 
strange name, sometimes combining Irish and Welsh words. Relating them 
to tunes, every piece is in a measure, or in a combination of measures 
sometimes. You could have a type of chorus [diwedd section] in a 
different measure to the main tune. So the whole sequence becomes longer
 again. So you could have something like two rounds of 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 
[Corffiniwr] and then a round of 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 [Tytyr Bach] at the end
 of that, all forming one part [or section]. And if we had twelve parts 
or more, a piece could easily be 20 minutes long. So they kept track of 
the parts, knowing the measures like that. It’s a bit like the Old Grey 
Goose multiplied by the Old Grey Goose, if you want to think of it in 
traditional music terms! Or the Old Grey Goose multiplied by Doctor 
O’Neill’s!</p>
<p><strong>Is the Ap Huw manuscript difficult to read?</strong><br>
No. The tablature does look completely alien at the start, but once you 
get around Ap Huw’s handwriting it becomes much easier to read than dots
 in staff notation. This is because you can recognise chords or whole 
phrases as blocks.</p>
<p><strong>Is the Ap Huw manuscript online,&nbsp;and&nbsp;how long would it take&nbsp;to get your head around the notation of pieces?</strong><br>
If you do a search, you can find it online. From there there’s two ways 
you could go. You could try to decipher it all yourself which I wouldn’t
 recommend, unless you’re into Rubik’s cubes and things like that! Peter
 Greenhill’s work, who as I said passed it all on to me, is also 
available online. There’s an earlier thesis by Paul Whittaker which is 
also available online. That can give a good background before reading 
Greenhill’s work.</p>
<p>To get to play the music it actually doesn’t take that long. The 
technique is very different so it’s a bit of a commitment. When Peter 
passed on the music to me he said to me that I might not want to play 
the way he recommended because I already had my own technique. First of 
all I thought I would just learn it with the left hand treble [I 
normally play left hand bass] but it was too difficult for me, too 
finicky. So I ended up doing my own thing a bit. But if I was doing it 
again – if I knew then what I know now – I would follow the fingering 
the way he has deciphered it because it makes perfect sense to me.</p>
<p><strong>Does it specify what shoulder the harp is played on?</strong><br>
Not really, but the pictures of Welsh harps show the harp on the left 
shoulder, and some of the figuration and symbols&nbsp;in the Ap Huw 
manuscript hint that you’re looking at strings and fingers on the left 
side. But which shoulder it is played on doesn’t really make much 
difference because your hands are symmetrical anyway, so it’s not like 
you need to fundamentally change anything either way. Originally, or 
before you see depictions of harps, you see lyres on high crosses and in
 medieval illuminations. The lyre was held against the left shoulder 
with the right hand strumming, and with the left hand fingers blocking 
strings and shaping chords. This left hand function probably became more
 complicated later [plucking as well as blocking], while the right hand 
was acting only as a plectrum. So that right hand becomes the bow on a 
fiddle or the strumming hand on a guitar, while the left hand did the 
more dexterous fingering. This is probably how the harp ended up being 
played on the left shoulder. When keyboard instruments came in the 
treble was on the right hand side, so it eventually migrated to the 
right hand on the harp also. That’s my theory on it anyway!</p>
<p><strong>Can you play a favourite piece of yours from the Ap Huw manuscript? </strong><br>
This is a piece called Gosteg Dafydd Athro. The pattern for this is 
11001011, repeated for each section …[music, translation by Peter 
Greenhill].<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/293678695.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
And this goes on for another ten minutes or so.</p>
<p><strong>One of the techniques I noticed is that you use the back of your nail.</strong><br>
Yeah, well in the Ap Huw manuscript it says clearly that you use the 
back your nail in some cases [there’s a separate symbol for back-strikes
 with each finger, and one for the thumb].</p>
<p>I have found an expedient way of doing this particular one [Tafliad y
 Bys] using my forefinger, it’s not quite the way Peter Greenhill has 
it, but it is the only way I found that I was able to do it quickly and 
reliably. It uses the right fingers in the right direction with the 
proper damping but the hand position is different.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/293677627.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Can you show another Ap Huw piece where this back of the nail technique turns up, and give an idea of how much it turns up?</strong><br>
Well it turns up throughout the Ap Huw pieces. For instance another 
piece from the manuscript called Caniad San Silin uses this quite a lot.
 Again, it is a fairly long piece, following a combinition of the 
measure Mak y Mwn Byr [1100 1111] and Tytyr bach [0011 0011], and takes 
over 15 minutes to play the whole thing – here is some of it</p>
<p><strong>As you are tuning up can you explain your tuning system for this piece?</strong><br>
Ok, If you tune like this you get:<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/293677684.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
…[music]… G B D, and from the D we get D F A …[music]… with the D octave
 again. Then we get F A C …[music]… and A C E …[music]. So we have got 
all these beautiful chords. But what we haven’t got is …[music]… a C G 
that’s useable, or a E B that’s useable …[music]… so the piece will 
skirt around these chords and we won’t know, hopefully! …[Music,

<p>In a nutshell, that’s what my PhD research on harp tuning was about.</p>
<p><strong>Do these back of nail techniques and other Ap Huw techniques 
point towards techniques which could have been used later on in Irish 
music in the sixteenth and seventeenth century?</strong><br>
When I read Bunting’s fingerings first I thought they were a bit strange – I wondered did he<br>
make it all up. He gives some damping on his ornaments page [1840, p. 
24], but they are mostly trills anyway. It looks to me like Bunting’s 
page 24 was very influenced by Ap Huw’s page 35. There was a 
transliteration of this in the Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales [1807] and 
Bunting was in contact with the editors about it. So he was well aware 
of the Ap Huw manuscript and that it included a collection of ‘ornaments
 or figures’. So in a way Bunting might have been under pressure to 
compete with the Welsh material. That said it wasn’t known what the 
fingering for those was that time, and it turns that Bunting’s fingering
 patterns are very similar [to the Ap Huw], so that has to count for 
something.</p>
<p><strong>It sounds like although there are definite links with Irish 
harp music in the medieval period, but we shouldn’t read too much into 
how it informs later Irish harp music in the 17th and 18th centuries. 
Would you agree?</strong><br>
Let’s just say that O’Carolan’s music comes from a different stable 
altogether. But it might have been influenced by something that was 
related to what’s in the Ap Huw manuscript somewhere along the way. 
There is no question that the music that was played in Ireland or Wales 
or Scoltand, maybe in the 12th, 13th or 14th century, was very similar 
all around. According to Gerald of Wales’ account, they all imitated 
Ireland to rival each other in musical style. But how long did this 
last? Other influences came from the continent and everywhere else. We 
are where we are today because all these influences came and did what 
they did.</p>
<p><strong>But there’s also the huge difference between the music that 
came from Denis O’Hampsey and the other harpers at the 1792 Belfast harp
 meeting.</strong><br>
I don’t know about that, but there is diefinitely not as much difference
 between the Ap Huw music and traditional Irish music now as there is 
between the music in Ap Huw and Bunting, I would say.</p>
<p><strong>Absolutely and what I was also getting at was that even in a 
generation quite a lot of the music had died, the fact that O’Hampsey 
was the only musician at the Belfast harp meeting who played with his 
fingernails.</strong><br>
Yeah absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>And O’Hampsey had an older repertoire which could have stretched quite a way back.</strong><br>
Which he didn’t share by all accounts! He said to Bunting that it pained
 him too much to play the old tunes, that he wouldn’t bother! It’s a 
very frustrating thing. He played that little prelude Féach an gléas. He
 was giving out that the harpers of the day didn’t really understand the
 old music. So this older music he is talking about, we only have a 
snippet of it in what Bunting got from him. Under the hood the prelude 
doesn’t work like the Ap Huw music, but on the face of it the chords are
 similar to some of the pieces [profiadau in particular]. The way it is 
ornamented, you couldn’t justify changing the timing from the way 
Bunting has written it because he is consistent there. It is funny 
because Bunting says in the 1840 [p. 27] that all the chords were 
arpeggiated downwards. But he arpeggiated the prelude upwards twice in 
the original notebook [MS 29], but it’s downwards in one of his later 
arrangements [MS 12], and he blamed his engraver in a footnote [1840, p.
 87] for putting it upwards in the publication.</p>
<p>I think the one thing we can conclude is that you can’t be too 
dogmatic about any interpretation of what Bunting says. I mean the idea 
that the Irish wouldn’t have used the triads or thirds when they did use
 them in Wales way before that. Did they all of a sudden decide to stop 
using them in Ireland? It’s hard to imagine. If the Welsh were copying 
the Irish and they [the Welsh] were using all these [triads and thirds],
 did the Irish decide to stop, thinking “ah no the Welsh are copying us 
we’re going to stop doing that!” I don’t think so! So they probably did 
arpeggiate upwards and downwards when it suited them. In O’Hampsey’s day
 it wouldn’t have been as regulated as it would have been further back. I
 suppose it’s not so much that it would have been heavily regulated, but
 there wasn’t really anywhere to go in the medival system. I mean once 
you had learned a tune in a certain way [properly] there wasn’t room for
 adding or taking out stuff. Which would be great to know if you have 
learned a really long piece, that this is it – and there is no grey 
area. This finger this way, that finger that way, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>It seems that it would be a positive thing if there were more
 players of the early Irish harp, basing their interpretation of later 
music on a solid foundation of the Ap Huw manuscript. Even if there was 
no apparent relationship – for example, if someone heard them play an Ap
 Huw piece and the same person then heard them play an interpretation of
 a piece from Bunting say, that the pieces would not sound obviously 
alike. But that the player’s basis, their sensibility of what would 
sound “right”, would be based at least in part on the system which is 
laid out in black on white in the Ap Huw manuscript.</strong><br>
That would be a game changer for a lot of interpretations, for sure.</p>
<p>People who listen to a lot of sean-nós singing will tend to play 
things like song airs differently on the harp than people who don’t. I’m
 not saying that’s right or wrong, but that it’s different! So obviously
 if you’re coming from a certain background that will colour the way you
 play things – because I come from a dance music background and that 
colours how I play O’Carolan stuff, and any other stuff as well – 
rightly or wrongly again!</p>
<p><strong>Everyone recognizes that there must be a huge gap between how
 pieces were actually played and how they are presented in the Bunting 
or Neal collections. We don’t have exact guidance on how pieces were 
played, and so we do need to base your interpretation on something.</strong><br>
Absolutely. You want to be aware of what’s there in the early sources, 
is that what you’re saying? You do, you need to look at the manuscripts 
and be aware of what the baseline is, what’s solid and then go from 
there.</p>
<p><strong>So go from there and interpret, or modify in a sensible way. 
Sensible, as in if the goal is to reproduce music as close as possible 
to that which was noted down when the manuscripts were created.</strong><br>
Yeah, rectifying obvious errors, or you could choose to depart from 
what’s notated if you wanted to, as long you were upfront about it.</p>
<p><strong>As you say we can’t be too dogmatic about what we find in the
 18th and 19th century sources, but there must always have been a push 
for innovation?</strong><br>
As time went on, as new music came in, yes certainly. But in medieval 
times probably say pre-1500 or before there wouldn’t have been very much
 room for innovation, partly because they weren’t really competing with 
continental musicians and fashions. In other words, it would have been 
more introverted and conservative. Whatever old Gaelic style there was, 
musicians probably stuck to what they had, and passed it on that way. 
Things might have changed, but very slowly. Obviously they had 
innovation back then as well. But by all accounts very little of it and 
very slowly. Today we think of innovation in terms of from the cassette 
to the iPod in 30 years or so!</p>
<p><strong>I think that’s probably a good point to wrap up. Thanks so 
much. Could you play us out with that last Ap Huw piece you mentioned?</strong><br>
So this piece is called y Ddigan y Droell in Welsh, this has been 
translated as “Erddigan [a type of tune] of the spindle-whorl”, 
something that goes round and round. There’s no immediately discernible 
measure pattern in this because the chords are too different – that 
could be why it’s considered to be a more modern piece to the others in 
the manuscript…[music, translation by Peter Greenhill].<br>
