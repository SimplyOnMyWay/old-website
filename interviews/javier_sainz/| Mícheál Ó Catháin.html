<h2><em>“This early Irish harp is an instrument for which that famous 
phrase ‘less is more’ is quite true. So you need to take care with 
ornaments. They are there to give more meaning and beauty to the melody.
 But if you use too many, you will destroy the whole thing.”</em></h2>
<p>– Javier Sáinz</p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>Words &amp; images: Mícheál Ó Catháin</strong></h2>
<h1>From&nbsp;the&nbsp;Atlantic&nbsp;coast of&nbsp;northern Spain, 
Javier Sáinz is a pioneer in the revival of the early Irish 
harp.&nbsp;Deeply rooted in Cantabrian and Galician culture <span style="font-size: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.4;">with
 its rich&nbsp;Celtic&nbsp;connections, Javier has long been fascinated 
by&nbsp;the early culture, poetry and music of Ireland and Scotland. As 
well as his own native early Spanish harp music, he plays Irish and 
Scottish music of the 16th to 18th centuries on his&nbsp;replica of the 
Lamont Harp, a brass and gold strung early Scottish cláirseach from 
c.1500.<br>
I began this conversation with Javier in 2014, and we revisited the 
themes again in 2018, when I also filmed his playing of original and new
 compositions belonging to the old tradition. Of the many insights which
 Javier shares, I particularly admire his nuanced thinking on technique –
 here’s what he says:<br>
</span></h1>
<blockquote>
<h2><em>“Technique is something that grows from the inside of the 
instrument itself. So all you need is time and patience and finally you 
will find an easier, more secure way of playing, and that is the 
technique. Ultimately, this is the shortest path to creating music.”</em></h2>

<p>We cover the following&nbsp;topics in this broad-ranging conversation:<br>
1. Jointure &amp; Jigg – Javier plays his version of this beautiful 
piece, recorded over 200 years ago in both the Neal Collection and 
Bunting manuscripts, and shares in-depth insights into his arrangement. 
This is a piece explored independently by each artist in the <em>Early Irish Harp: the State of the Art</em>
 interview series. By comparing arrangements we can understand which 
aspects of their interpretations are shared in common and which are 
unique to the individual artists.<br>
2. Javier’s musical journey and how he arrived at the early Irish harp<br>
3. Meeting others in the early Irish harp community<br>
4. Insights into the design of the early Irish harp – having a harp made, string spacing, <em>na comhluí</em>, origins of left shoulder playing<br>
5. Tuning – developing the ear, tuning systems – Pythagorean, mean tone, Equal Temperament<br>
6. Manuscript and printed sources<br>
7. Composing new pieces in the old tradition – Javier shares his 
thoughts on composing in the historical idiom, once the foundations of 
the old tradition are mastered. He plays two pieces.<br>
8. The film clip which closes the interview – Javier’s newly composed <em>McKenna’s Air and Variations</em> – is a beautiful portrait of Javier, his harp – a gold-strung Lamont replica, and his music.</p>

<h2><strong>JOINTURE &amp; JIGG</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Mícheál Ó Catháin:<br>
Javier, for this interview you have prepared an arrangement of the 
Jointure and Jigg, a beautiful piece recorded over 200 years ago in both
 the Neal Collection and Bunting manuscripts. This is a piece explored 
independently by each artist in the <em>Early Irish Harp: the State of the Art</em>
 interview series. I’m excited to learn your unique approach to this 
piece, what musical choices you make based on your insights into the old
 tradition, and the elements of your own style which show up.</strong></p>
<p>Javier Sáinz:<br>
Sure. Well here it is …[music].</p>
<p><iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/297665693.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
<strong>So Javier, which version of the Jointure did you look at, both 
the Bunting and the Neal? And when you chose, why, which one did you 
find more appealing?</strong><br>
Well I had a look at both versions. I found the John and William Neal 
version more interesting and I just preferred the melody. I found it was
 somehow easier to imbue with meaning in my arrangement. This was 
especially true with the Jointure air – the jig is more fluent, its 
melody almost volunteers chord options. In the case of the Jointure air,
 I have to say it is not an easygoing melody. It took longer to make an 
arrangement because the melody is quite open and it doesn’t indicate 
very much which direction to go. There are many open doors.</p>
<p>The John and William Neal version was published as we know in 1724. 
According to information we have, the Jointure air at least, and 
probably the jig also, were composed by Thomas Connellan. He was active 
from the second half of the 17th century, so the Neal version is 
relatively close in era to Connellan’s own lifetime.</p>
<p>We need to consider that at the time of printing, good harpers were 
still active, following the tradition. There were more harpers in 1724 
than at the end of the 18th century at the Belfast harp meeting with 
Bunting and O’Hampsey. In this first part of the 18th century there were
 still harpers, like Carolan for example, Lyons, etc.</p>
<p>So it all means to me that the Neal version, is in fact closer to the
 original. In any case I played both versions, and my inclination was 
directed to John &amp; William Neal. As it happens, the Neal collection 
is one of my favorite sources. So I decided to work on that, on the Neal
 version.</p>
<p>And this being said you need to be clear when making an arrangement 
of these two tunes that they go together, one after the other. One being
 an air, a slow air, with a lot of feeling<br>
and expression. And then the jig is more lively. It is fundamental for 
any arrangement to clearly separate the spirit of the two tunes. What I 
mean is not to play the air too fast, the jig in a normal speed because 
otherwise, there is no contrast. So what we need here is, whatever the 
arrangement, to create a contrast. So the slow air should be played 
slow, and then the jig in a normal speed, let’s say it will be a good 
contrast. Sometimes the tendency could be to play the air a little 
faster, but then this contrast doesn’t work.</p>
<p>So the air required much more time to find an arrangement. Especially
 the beginning of the tune where in the Neal version it is in 4/4 time. 
At the beginning there are several bars in which half of the bar is 
without notes. So you need to fill that somehow, to fill the<br>
bar with the arrangement. Otherwise the melody doesn’t flow.</p>
<p>In making an arrangement, once you know which chords you are going to
 use, you need to develop your imagination and try to find different 
combinations and possibilities. You become closer to whatever idea you 
have in your mind. And that’s the way it works. Some other melodies are 
so meaningful in themselves that the arrangement goes quicker but in 
this case it is a difficult melody. You are not sure what the meaning of
 the melody itself is.</p>
<p>First you need to find different chords for the first three beats, 
landing on the G-major which as an arriving point. So this G-major which
 is sat in the middle of the bar, you need to develop that. The first 
time I played the A part, let’s say… once you find the chords, which in 
my opinion are B, E-minor, and then G-major. So like this, adding some 
ornaments …[music].<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/297667237.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0">&lt;span
 data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; 
overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" 
class="mce_SELRES_start"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;</iframe><br>
So then I give a whole chord of G going down. I have used this technique
 …[shows]… in the last year, to give more – because this is a slow air –
 to give more expression and deepness to the bass. I sometimes use the 
the second finger, not playing with the nail but in a vertical position 
playing with the flesh, that gives a more rounded, [deeper] sound. In 
this case it works, in my opinion, very well …[music].</p>
<p>The second and third bar, again, we have this empty space that you 
need to fill again with the same chord, G-major. An important point here
 is if you look to the melody at the end of the first part, which you 
then need to repeat again, it’s a single note covering the whole bar, 
four beats. So obviously there, if you [play only that single note in 
the melody, with no bass] there’s a lot of empty time. So you need to 
fill that, and in this case I decided to create a dissonant movement 
playing a chord of G-major, but then I introduced the C, the four-chord,
 to create a little tension, maintaining the interest, and then 
resolving finally in G.</p>
<p>The first ending …[music]… and ending the melody, well the bass if you like, in B, in a third.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/297668211.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
This is the ending of the first A [part]. The ending of the second A 
[part] has to be bigger, more definitive. So that’s why I used …[music]…
 so I end with a big bass. Yeah I do the same C and then B …[music].</p>
<p>At the start of the B-part… well the melody starts on the E note …[music].<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/297667978.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
So obviously it’s not going to be the chord of G because the E is not in
 that chord. Right? In the chord of G the three notes are G, B, D. So we
 have an E here at the start. So that immediately [directs] my attention
 to find another chord.</p>
<p>E-minor didn’t work. C worked very well because there is a 
progression – next we go to G major so …[music]. So it’s the same 
pattern again, it’s repeating … and now …[music]. So it’s basically the 
same theme but in a different [register]. So the first is C and then 
it’s G-major. [Music]… and now it is the resolution, because it is 
looking for resolution which is this beautiful moment …[music]. And now 
the typical D-major into G-major …[music].</p>
<p>This is the most difficult point in the whole melody, to find out 
harmonies here, because it’s very rich. That’s why I started to really 
like the tune. It is quite rich from a harmonic point of view. The 
melody is very well constructed.</p>
<p><strong>I’m really interested in the pair of three note motifs or 
themes you have identified, one in each half of the Jointure air, and 
how you relate them to each other. Could you play each, to show what you
 mean?</strong><br>
In the first part, the main theme is this here …[music]… etc., and it is repeated.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/297666258.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
In my arrangement, by the way, the second time I play the first part I 
change the octave just here [at this moment] …[music]… and now I’m back 
to …[music]. Now …[music]… this is the C, etc. So it keeps going, and 
then after playing this …[music]… it is not the same melody but it’s the
 same rhythmical [decending pattern]. There are the same [intervals 
between] notes and the same pattern, but with different notes.</p>
<p>And not only in the chord of E as in here …[music]… the chord doesn’t
 change. But here there are some movements …[music]… and now we are back
 to the first part again, so the ending of the B-part is the same as the
 A-part. This is something which is quite typical in the Irish and 
Scottish music.</p>
<p><strong>I was wondering when you said at the start of the B-part that the E-minor chord wouldn’t work. Can you elaborate?</strong><br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/335601297.html" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
I’ll say it in this way. Any important note you have, let’s say you have
 a G in the melody. Automatically this G could belong to three chords 
only. Which are the chords which the G note is in. So the main choice is
 G major obviously …[music]. It could be E-minor …[music]… or it could 
be C. Obviously there are no other possibilities because, for example, 
there is no G in the chord of D.</p>
<p>So that gives you a first aid whenever finding the chord. Knowing 
that as a note of the melody, it could belong to three chords. So you 
need to choose, and in choosing, the present moment of that note is 
important. But always you need to think in the progression …what is 
next? In this case to me it’s obvious that the C is a beautiful 
beginning of the B-part. Suddenly a C-major chord. And then it is 
obvious that it needs to move to G-major – that’s my approach in any 
case.</p>
<p><strong>Why not play the E-minor, I’m curious?</strong><br>
Well, so …[music].<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/335600612.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
It is possible to play the E-minor chord. As I was saying it could be 
E-minor, it could be C-major or could be A-minor. My option was C 
because of this progression then from C to G. And because after the 
beginning of the B-part, we are going to arrive at E, and the E[-chord] 
is going to be there. But this beginning of the B-part, I found it more 
interesting to give place to a new theme – so starting with C – and then
 we will inevitably arrive at E. If I had played E, well it’s fine, it 
works, and then G-major. But then you will arrive to E, so … well, it’s 
an option.</p>
<p><strong>You like that transition going from C-major to G-major?</strong><br>
No, from G-major which is the end of the first part, into the second part starting with the C-major.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, and so you consider that to be an important transition?</strong><br>
To me it gives interest. It clearly sustains the melody. And from an harmonic point of view&nbsp;it makes sense.</p>
<p>E-minor is another option – I will not deny that. So that’s the 
compromise. In doing an arrangement you need sometimes to choose. 
Understanding what I was going to do next&nbsp;I thought C-major works 
better, in my arrangement. In another arrangement E-minor&nbsp;could be 
beautiful. This is the open thing, especially for air melodies like 
this. It’s complex. And in the melody there is a little ambiguity. So 
you need to take decisions.</p>
<p><strong>What mode do you consider the piece to be in?</strong><br>
Well this is another ambiguous question to reply to. Because let’s say 
that all the endings in the first part and in second power go to G-major
 ending. This is a very … not modal way, but [reflecting] modern 
harmony, Baroque. So at least half of the A-part and half of the B-part –
 the endings – are in G-major. It is like Miss Hamilton by Cornelius 
Lyons, which is a G-major tune clearly, but it is melancholy. That 
combination of major chords G, and being not “happy”, I find those tunes
 very interesting.</p>
<p>The transition from modal music to tonal music cannot be given an 
exact date. There are many mixtures and experiments along the way. But 
if I need to choose I’d say this is a G-major air, with modal things.</p>
<p>In this sense C-major makes sense [at the start of the B-part] 
because as you know in a major tune, the most important chords are the 
tonic, let’s say G, and then C- and D-chords. So the chord of C, if this
 is a G-major tune, it is important to define the tonality.</p>
<p>But as I am saying to you there is not an exact moment that composer left the modal system and went to the tonal.</p>
<p><strong><br>
Can we talk about your arrangement of the Jigg?</strong><br>
Yes. Here in this jig, the first part starts here, on this G …[music]… then it goes to D.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/297668990.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
But it is up in the upper treble end, in this octave …[shows]. If I play
 the ending …[music]. So you see that at the beginning of the second 
part is this low low D …[shows]. Usually it is the opposite, the 
tendency is to give more brilliancy [in the B-part], so going up.</p>
<p>I found that that’s beautiful and that’s why I put the whole chord of
 G at that moment, at the start of the second part of the jig. In the 
first part I’m using this G-chord basically …[shows]. At the beginning 
…[music]. And ending in this G …[music]. And now I made the big chord of
 G while going down with a melody. These are ways, in my opinion, to 
sustain the interest in the melody.</p>
<p>So if I take just the melody the ending of the first part it is more simple …[music].<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/297668777.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
In the ending of the second part the harmony is the same, but what the 
composer does – in a very clever way because it gives interesting to the
 ending – he adds more notes. So if I play the ending of the second part
 …[music].</p>
<p>This is a very musical thing to do – just to add more notes keeping 
the same harmony. So the audience surely know that they are arriving at 
the end of the piece. A final explosion of light! It’s very common to do
 this in Baroque music, this is a good example of it.</p>
<p><strong>Can you play that ending to the jig B-part once more, a little slower?</strong><br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/297668415.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>It would be great to learn what ornamentation you use for the jig.</strong><br>
Ornamentation is an essential part in an arrangement, and the way I 
understand ornamentation is just to give more meaning to the important 
notes of the melody. The ornament I use the most, I think – because 
sometimes you develop this instinctively – but I think that the ornament
 I use most is the simple… let me see, at the beginning for example 
…[music]… this. I use this ornament all through the tune.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/297668523.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
Towards the ending of the B-part – which as I was saying is the same 
harmonically as the A-part – at the beginning of that movement I use a 
different ornament. This is precisely to give a signal that something 
new is coming, which are all these new additional notes …[music].</p>
<p>But again, this [should only be done] at important points of the melody. In this<br>
ornament I was using a note that I’ve never used before. It’s not in the
 melody. It’s this C at the top, it is the most treble sound in the 
whole arrangement. So that also keeps the attention of the ear because 
it is something new.</p>
<p>It is very important to say, at the end of the jig I needed to choose
 an option between the typical ending of G-major only, or, to do 
something to prolong with different notes. And I decided that using 
different notes was a way to return to the air, by using the same device
 as I use all through the air.</p>
<p>So in this way, the two tunes are brought closer together. Otherwise,
 the Jigg has nothing to do musically with the Jointure air. You have 
some other tunes – air and jig – where both are absolutely related in 
the theme. One example of this is <em>Port Patrick</em>. Actually in this case, the jig is the air played in 6/8.</p>
<p>But in the case of the Jointure and Jigg there is a beautiful air, 
and then a jig, and there is no relationship, no pattern in the melody, 
shared by the two tunes. So that is why I like to do this at the end of 
the Jigg, as a remembering of the Jointure air. I’ll play this ending 
again to show this effect …[music].<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/297668335.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong><br>
You mentioned the piece <em>Port Patrick</em> there. Could you play this?</strong><br>
I’ll play an excerpt, the A-parts of both the air and the jig, to show 
how they are clearly related. The full piece can be found in James 
Oswald’s publication <em>The Caledonian Pocket Companion</em> from 1745.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/297667804.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
So here I was playing [the A-parts of] the beautiful Scottish air Port 
Patrick. It is an air [followed by] a jig. I think it’s quite easy to 
hear in the music that it’s basically the same tune. What the composer 
did was to change the shape of the notes giving another rhythm. So the 
jig is in 6/8, in double time.</p>
<p>Different to this is our case, the Jointure, where you have an air 
and then, immediately afterwards, a jig. But they are not related 
musically. That’s why in my arrangement&nbsp;at the end of the jig I 
finished with a long chord using the same device as I did&nbsp;all 
through the air. It’s a tricky way let’s say, at least at the very end, 
to make a&nbsp;connection between the jig and the previous air.</p>
<h2>JAVIER’S MUSICAL JOURNEY</h2>
<p><strong>Can you explain how you became a musician in the first place, and then also how you arrived at the early Irish harp?</strong></p>
<p>Naturally as a child I was attracted just by sound. The beauty of sound, of hearing notes.</p>
<p>A next step was when I was 10 years old. I come from Spain where the 
guitar is a very common instrument. You take a guitar and you pluck the 
strings, and then you start to learn that its sound is beautiful in 
itself, but that you can’t produce the sound you want. So here starts 
the learning of the instrument. And that takes a whole life, because you
 never stop learning.</p>
<p>Another, more philosophical step, is when you start understanding 
music as a means of expression. The language of music in itself – with 
the consonance and dissonance, the tonic and so on – there is a perfect 
correspondence between music itself and the whole of Nature, which is 
fascinating. That’s a philosophical side of the harp and of music 
generally.</p>
<p>So I started studying classical guitar at music school. But then I 
was fascinated by hearing Derek Bell playing. That was when I was 20 
years old, and I realised I was really attracted to the harp. So I saved
 some money and bought my first harp, which was a neo-Irish harp. But 
without any teacher I had to do the work by myself. From the very 
beginning, I adopted the natural position in which all the historical 
harps are being played, not the classical or pedal harp position. 
Naturally I was playing like that – it was an instinctive. I kept going 
on that instrument. At the same time as I was learning the technique and
 tunes, I was listening very much to Derek Bell and Allison Kinnaird. As
 I listened I was going deeper and deeper into that older tradition. And
 that meant I really needed a wire-strung harp.</p>
<p>So, when I started on the wire-strung harp in the 1990s, I already 
had the correct technique. As I said, with the gut-strung or Neo-Irish 
harp I had already been using basically the same technique, with 
damping, the historical position of the hand, all of that. It was not a 
traumatic change at all. Later I bought a renaissance harp, and again 
that requires basically the same technique. &nbsp;So happily enough from
 the very beginning I practiced this historical technique.</p>
<p>There were no teachers in those days, thirty years ago. I remember 
talking about this with Bill Taylor, the Scottish harper, and basically 
he had the same story. He started out alone with the wire strung harp, 
as did several others I have since met. We all arrived at similar 
conclusions. So at different points on planet Earth about thirty years 
ago, different musicians – by playing on historical instruments – were 
independently converging on similar practices for wire-strung harp 
technique.</p>
<p>I believe the musical technique of an instrument – any instrument – 
is not something you invent. It is something that grows from the inside 
of the instrument itself. So all you need is time and patience and 
finally you will find an easier, more secure way of playing, and that is
 the technique. Ultimately, this is the shortest path to creating music.</p>
<p>Then there is the whole realm of style – every musician needs 
technique, but after that it is their own personality that is showing 
through.</p>
<p><strong>So Derek Bell is the first influence that led you to the wire-strung harp?</strong><br>
To be fair and complete, Derek Bell, and especially the long play record <em>Chieftains 5</em>. I remember when Derek Bell took a wire-strung harp and played <em>Tabhar dom do lámh</em> by Rory Dall Ó Catháin – that was magic.</p>
<p>And also a Spanish harper Emilio Cao who played the Celtic harp. He 
was from Galicia in the north west of Spain. In 1977 he produced a 
beautiful long play record <em>Fonte do Araño</em>. That sound really impressed me. I always loved that recording.</p>
<p>On the Scottish side, at the beginning of the 1980s, Allison Kinnaird
 was clearly the most interesting player in Scotland. Though then she 
was still playing the gut-strung harp, later she moved to the 
wire-strung harp also.</p>
<p>Those three were my inspirations at the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>It sounds like you were ploughing your own furrow, creating 
your own path, with few enough influences. Not like we have today, where
 we can go to <em>Scoil na gCláirseach</em> for example, to listen and learn from great tutors all in one place.</strong><br>
The main difference is that today anyone interested in the early Irish 
harp, he or she has channels to harp-makers and teachers. So it’s much 
easier in this way than thirty years ago. But at the end of the day, it 
is still a personal journey. It is good to have a teacher, but even with
 that guide, you then need to put in the work by yourself, in solitude.</p>
<p><strong>You’re from the north of Spain. Can you describe where you grew up?</strong><br>
I was born in a little region on the north coast of Spain, called 
Cantabria. To the east is the Basque country, to the west is Asturias, 
and further west again is Galicia. Some people don’t know this, since 
Spain is obviously a Mediterranean country, but the north part of Spain 
is quite different in climate. This is because of the mountains, the 
Pyrenees that separate France and Spain. The Pyrenees don’t stop on the 
border, they keep going west up to Galicia. So the north side of Spain, 
on the northern side of the Pyrenees, has Atlantic weather. The 
landscape is completely green. The temperature is 3 or 4 degrees higher 
than in Ireland, which is beautiful.</p>
<p>So my landscape growing up was not the beautiful Mediterranean 
landscape of olive trees and so on, but it was very much a landscape of 
leaves and green grass and wonderful woods. Happily this landscape is 
still intact in the north of Spain today. Immense oak and beech woods.</p>
<p>And so I was born in that atmosphere. I think I clearly understood 
early on that in Europe there are links between the land and the 
culture. I could see a main focus of the European cultural tradition in 
the Mediterranean – more precisely in Greece and in southern Italy. 
These places form a kind of heart for the whole Mediterranean culture, 
spreading from there to Spain, Southern France, etc. And then I could 
see on the Atlantic side – to me this was clear – that somehow Scotland 
and Ireland had preserved something really old. That they formed a heart
 of that part of Atlantic Europe.</p>
<p>So I was naturally attracted by Irish music and poetry, and all these
 kinds of things. The same as a person from the south of Spain could be 
attracted to old Greek music and history. It doesn’t mean that I am not 
interested in Greek culture, in fact I’m totally interested in Greek 
philosophy and such things. But I’m talking about something deeper, 
which is the landscape in which you are born. I think this has enormous 
meaning in the life of many people, on the way they look at the world.</p>
<p><strong>In another interview in this <em>Early Irish Harp: the State of the Art</em> series, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210121164713/http://michealocathain.com/interviews/ann-heymann-1">Ann Heymann</a>
 suggests a fascinating link between the shape of the Trinity harp lying
 on its back, and the skull of a Right whale. I’m wondering if this 
reflects a link between this early Irish harp and the countries along 
the Atlantic coast of northern Europe.</strong></p>
<p>No, this is poetry. I think it is obvious that when the triangular 
harp was created, they were not thinking about whales. They just took a 
functional view. Actually the innovation they invented here in Ireland 
or in the west of Scotland, was to add the fore-pillar to join the neck 
and the soundboard. Previous harps in Egypt or Mesopotamia were 
semi-circular or angled harps, without a fore-pillar.</p>
<p>So this three-sided harp is the invention that took place here in 
Ireland and the Highlands of Scotland. But – at least in my view – it is
 obvious that in creating a three-sided harp, which is a very practical 
and functional thing, they were not thinking about whales.</p>
<p>However in poetic terms, the three-sided harp may then have been 
considered to look like a whale skull and the strings like golden hair, 
etc. There are a lot of different myths, stories and symbolism 
associated with the harp.</p>
<p>For me, the functional and the poetic are two different things.</p>
<p><strong>So that is a fascinating insight into the landscape you grew 
up in on the Atlantic coast of northern Spain, and the draw you felt 
towards Scotland and Ireland. So when you first heard Derek Bell’s 
playing, did you already have that feeling of shared cultural links?</strong><br>
In the north and north-west of Spain we don’t have the musical richness 
of Ireland, but tales and traditions are strong. For example, many tales
 feature mythological wee people. These stories are very similar to 
those in Ireland. The atmosphere of these tales is very similar – <em>misty</em>
 I would say, and close to a wild nature. Not clear cut like 
Mediterranean traditions which are very bright, where all shapes of 
objects are clear, blue skies and all that. On these Atlantic shores, 
the shapes of everything are more… not so clear. It is related to the 
rain and the mist which are commonplace in these regions. So that is the
 atmosphere where I was born. That’s it.<br>

<p><strong>In Gallicia and Asturias, I’m aware that there is a piping tradition.</strong><br>
Oh yes, in Cantabria too. And in Galicia there are two kinds of pipes. 
There is no wire-strung harp tradition, that is unique to Ireland and 
Scotland. Though in Spain there is a great tradition of other historical
 harps – Medieval, Renaissance and the Spanish Baroque harps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>MEETING OTHERS IN THE EARLY IRISH HARPING COMMUNITY</h2>
<p><strong>Can you talk about the revival of the early Irish harp in recent years?</strong><br>
We are dealing with a very particular, a very special kind of harp. 
Though it was definitely played widely during Irish and Scottish 
history, it was never as popular an instrument as say the acoustic 
guitar is today. Obviously we also have what we call the Celtic or 
neo-Irish harp which is very much played, among other reasons because it
 is easier to play. At least this is my experience, having played for 
years on both instruments.</p>
<p>The work at <em>Scoil na gCláirseach</em> for instance is wonderful 
and fundamental and the number of people involved in the playing of this
 instrument is gradually increasing. But we can’t expect to rival the 
popularity of other instruments. However there are measures, and by 
these measures the popularity of the early Irish harp is increasing in a
 good direction.</p>
<p><strong>I have noticed for the last few years an increase in the 
knowledge about the early Irish harps themselves, and that more of the 
various manuscripts are being explored and rigorously re-interpreted. So
 maybe we shouldn’t be thinking in terms of the number of harpers. 
Certainly we’re here today talking about the current state of the art. 
An art which is being practiced again in the past thirty to forty years,
 drawing back various curtains which go back to the 1792 Belfast harp 
meeting at least. We have a lot of information in manuscript form, in 
published arrangements based on those manuscripts, and many other 
related companions and reference books. These sources are now becoming 
more – not mainstream – but the musicians involved are becoming much 
more familiar with this work and starting to play it out, performing 
these pieces from the old tradition on accurate replica instruments. At 
least that’s what I’ve noticed – has that been your experience also?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, well the work in the last thirty years – the recovery of this 
instrument, the repertoire, sources, techniques – has been immense. So 
the level of knowledge we have now is much bigger and substantial. Mind 
you thirty years ago, it was almost a desert.</p>
<p>In terms of sources, today most of the sources are printed in 
facsimiles, not only in Ireland but also in Scotland. The makers of the 
harps are improving. At the beginning it was difficult to find someone 
able to do it – to make an early Irish harp accurate in relation to the 
museum originals.</p>
<p>Now you can choose from various harp-makers of the early Irish harp, 
and the quality is increasing. It is the same with other historical 
harps, Renaissance harps, Baroque harps. We were a little late compared 
to the lute or the harpsichord. The recovery for these instruments 
started earlier, in the 1950’s and 1960’s. &nbsp;The early Irish harp 
was virtually abandoned, and since the end of the 1970s, we have come a 
long way along the road to recovery – of recovering our knowledge of the
 museum instruments, the music, and the playing techniques.</p>
<p><strong>So how did you then meet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210121164713/http://michealocathain.com/interviews/siobhan-armstrong">Siobhán Armstrong</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210121164713/http://michealocathain.com/interviews/ann-heymann-2">Ann Heymann</a> and others in the early Irish harping community?</strong><br>
I met them at the same time, and in the same place. In January 2002, in 
Glasgow, there was an informal congress in a big Victorian house. A 
congress on fingernail technique. There I met not only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210121164713/http://michealocathain.com/interviews/ann-heymann-1">Ann Heymann</a> and &nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210121164713/http://michealocathain.com/interviews/siobhan-armstrong">Siobhán Armstrong</a>, but also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210121164713/http://michealocathain.com/interviews/simon-chadwick">Simon Chadwick</a>,
 Barnaby Brown the Scottish piper, and Bill Taylor who I knew before. 
Coincidently, it was right at the beginning of the Euro currency. 
&nbsp;It’s only a curiosity, but that is why I remember the date – the 
very first month with the new Euro coins and paper.&nbsp;And the 
following summer, in August 2003, was the first <em>Scoil na gCláirseach</em>, with just Siobhán and Ann teaching. That was the very first, in the same place it is in now, Kilkenny.</p>
<p><strong>Had you met anyone at that congress before?</strong><br>
The only one I knew from before was Bill Taylor, who lives in 
Strathpeffor not far from Inverness. I met him at a traditional French 
music festival in the middle of France, Saint-Chartier. It was a very 
good festival, surrounding a castle in a park, with a lot of instrument 
makers. That was in the 1990s. Bill Taylor was there playing an Ardival 
harp. Ardival Harps is a company based in Strathpeffor and Bill Taylor 
is involved in the production of wire strung and gut strung historical 
harps, as the designer in the workshops. That’s when we met.</p>
<p><strong>This is something I’m starting to understand – going back to 
the 1990’s and earlier, if you wanted to play the early Irish or 
wire-strung harp, you either had to be harp maker yourself, or you had 
to work very closely with a harp maker. What was your experience?</strong><br>
It is always risky to order a harp – you never know what will arrive. 
Naturally there are some better harp-makers than others, but even with 
the best maker possible, there are many factors influencing the final 
quality.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 1990s I was on a trip to Brittany. I met a 
man who made wire-strung harps. And I ordered one. It took two years – a
 long time. I can’t remember his name. It looked wonderful, but I didn’t
 like the sound.</p>
<p>Then through Bill Taylor and Alison Kinnaird, I met Robert Evans from
 Wales. To my knowledge he was the first to start making near-exact 
replicas. He made Alison Kinnaird a harp. Robert Evans had an apprentice
 at the time, Guy Flockhart, and Guy made my first Lamont replica. The 
Lamont harp is a 15th century Scottish harp. Guy also made the 
reproduction, at the Collins Barracks museum, of the Cloyne Harp. He 
decorated this harp colourfully. Anyway, that was my first Lamont.</p>
<p><strong>So you arrived at this congress in 2002 in Glasgow with your 
Guy Flockhart Lamont replica. And the following summer, in 2003, you 
went to <em>Scoil</em> with that harp?</strong><br>
No, I first went to <em>Scoil na gCláirseach</em> in 2005.</p>
<p><strong>Ah that’s when we first met I think.</strong><br>
Yes, that was in 2005. But back to the 2002 congress in Glasgow – one of
 the aims was to produce a CD-ROM of early Irish and Scottish harp 
technique. It was published in 2012 by <em>Siubhal</em>, the label 
directed by Barnaby Brown. The idea was to feature three players – Ann 
Heymann, Bill Taylor and myself – filming the hands working on the 
strings, and playing pieces of different levels of difficulty. The 
associated book includes all the music played, with the fingering and a 
lot of information.</p>
<p>For someone who lives remote from any teacher, that CD-ROM could be a
 help as a starting point, providing a look at some advanced players. 
The footage of the hands is very clear, to the extent that you can see 
all my mistakes (laughing)! As I said, you are alway learning. That was 
in 2002, and my learning process still continues.</p>
<p><strong>Right now we are trying to get a snapshot of the early Irish 
harp – the current state of the art. That congress sounds like it would 
have given a snapshot in 2002, ten years before the first conversations 
in this <em>Early Irish Harp: the State of the Art</em> &nbsp;series of interviews. It’s a good placeholder for anyone tracking back the development of the most recent revival.</strong></p>
<p>For anyone looking back in 80 years time, lets say, that congress 
will be an important date, a milestone in what will hopefully be a full 
recovery of this instrument.</p>
<p><strong><em>Scoil</em> then, in 2005. Were you playing your current <em>Lamont</em> harp at this stage?</strong><br>
At <em>Scoil</em> in 2005 I had my Flockhart <em>Lamont</em>. But this harp on front of me here is my second <em>Lamont.</em></p>
<h2>INSIGHTS INTO THE DESIGN OF THE EARLY IRISH HARP</h2>
<p><strong>Is this a David Kortier instrument?</strong><br>
Right</p>
<p><strong>Can you explain how you collaborated with David Kortier on the making of this harp?</strong><br>
He is a wonderful professional, based in Minnesota in the U.S. He has 
all the plans and templates of the early Irish harp museum instruments 
and produces exact replicas from these templates. So basically I didn’t 
have to do anything – except to wait and pay at the end.</p>
<p>Of course I insisted that the spacing of the strings should be exact,
 as with the original. Other than that, I left it all up to him, 
trusting his professional judgement. That said, I was praying, because 
it is alway risky when you order a harp. In this case I was quite happy 
with the result.</p>
<p><strong>I think it is a beautiful sweet sounding harp</strong><br>
Also I like the aesthetic of the Lamont harp. It is very austere and it 
is my preference not to have many carvings – that’s a personal thing.</p>
<p><strong>It would be very interesting to know more about this. Because
 this is one of the early instruments that Kortier made, alongside the 
two Trinity harps that he made, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210121164713/http://michealocathain.com/interviews/siobhan-armstrong">Siobhán Armstrong</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210121164713/http://michealocathain.com/interviews/ann-heymann-2">Ann Heymann</a> play. Can you tell us the story of how this Kortier Lamont was made?</strong><br>
This harp was made in 2008, so isn’t really one of Kortier’s first early
 Irish harp replicas. Siobhán Armstrong and Ann Heymann’s harps were 
made earlier. So this harp came a little later and it is a fair and 
exact replica – particularly in the spacing of the strings. With all 
these museum harps, the spacing between the bass strings is narrower 
than the rest of the harp and this is what I wanted, an instrument 
absolutely faithful to the original. In the 1990s Kortier was not yet 
using this varying spacing between bass strings.</p>
<p><strong>Does the Lamont have the full joint at the base of the fore-pillar, that we can tell exactly where the lowest note was?</strong><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><strong>That’s a little different to the <em>Trinity, </em>for which&nbsp;we don’t actually know what that angle was, or how the lowest note was strung.</strong><br>
Ah right.</p>
<p><strong>For the bass strings below the G’s of <em>na comhluí</em> the spacing is quite a bit narrower than for the treble strings above <em>na comhluí</em>. Is that related to being able to do more intricate techniques up in the treble end?</strong><br>
In my opinion, this difference in spacing is clearly related to how 
makers produced the holes for the tuning-pins in the neck of the harp. A
 consequence of this, as I will explain, is the need to have <em>na comhluí</em> – the two adjacent strings tuned to the same pitch.</p>
<p>There is no ‘magic’ or esoteric philosophy needed to explain <em>na comhluí</em>,
 in my opinion. The simple magic of reality is enough. There has to be a
 practical reason as we are dealing with a musical instrument created to
 make music.</p>
<p>Once I began playing an accurate replica, the reason becomes quite 
clear to me. Accurate replicas have narrower spacing between strings in 
the bass. Evidence suggests that when making holes in the neck for the 
tuning-pins, makers in the old days kept the same distance between them.
 Consequently, due to the higher elevation of the neck where the bass 
strings go, the spacing between the bass strings was different – 
narrower – than the rest of the strings. This makes playing more 
difficult – especially if you are blind as was commonplace for the old 
harpers – as it destroys the uniform distance of intervals like the 
octave, a fundamental interval to have in the memory of the fingers. To 
correct this anomaly they – most probably the musicians – added an extra
 string precisely where it was most effective – right above the highest 
bass string which had a narrower spacing, and closer to the normal 
spacing area. In this way for a harp starting in GG all the bass octaves
 were then equal to the rest of the harp.</p>
<p>This is my opinion, an opinion based on my own experience with the 
instrument. When in the 1990s I received my first Lamont by Guy 
Flockhart, it was also exactly a replica in the spacing of the strings. 
That difference in the spacing of the strings was something I wasn’t 
aware of. And most makers those days were using equal spacing between 
the strings. Then I looked at good photos of the original and I could 
see that, yes, the spacing is narrower there.</p>
<p>As a beginner I decided “I don’t want two Gs, I’m going to remove one”. So I took off one of <em>na comhluí</em>
 strings. And it was impossible – I mean very difficult to play – 
because I was dealing with two different octave distances. So after a 
week or two I decided to go back to <em>na comhluí</em>, and immediately I realized it was much easier in this way, that this was a pragmatic reason for <em>na comhluí</em> strings.</p>
<p>I’m trying to give a practical answer, a real one that resolves a 
problem. What I’m saying is difficult to understand unless you have an 
accurate replica regarding the strings spacing. A conclusion of what I’m
 saying is, if I’m right in my opinion about <em>na comhluí</em> – that if you have an early Irish harp with equal spacing throughout – it would be incorrect or illogical to have <em>na comhluí</em>
 strings. This is because you are going to create problems where there 
are no problems – you are going to destroy the octave equality by adding
 a <em>comhluí</em> string in among strings which already have an equal 
spacing. You will get two octave distances when previously you had only 
one. And that’s no good.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anywhere where your hand spacing has to change as 
you go down, playing octaves. In other words, if you’re playing octaves 
up in the treble end, your fingers are set a certain distance apart. As 
you down is there any point where you have to adjust the distance?</strong><br>
Yes, in the last three strings at the bottom, EE, DD and CC, the distance is reduced. But down as far as <em>na comhluí</em>
 G, it is equal. Which is good enough. On a harp with the first bass in 
GG -and not in CC as the Lamont- all octave distances are equal.</p>
<p><strong>Have you thoughts about playing on the left shoulder?</strong><br>
For me there have always been two mysteries with this instrument. I’ve 
been thinking about it often, as many other people have. One of those is
 <em>na comhluí</em> – why?! So you have heard my theory. And the other 
mystery is that from the very beginning the early Irish harp was played 
on the left shoulder. This is quite original in the sense that all the 
harps in the world are played on the right shoulder, as usually 95% of 
the people are right handed. So why was this harp played on the left 
shoulder, using the left hand to play the melody, and with the right 
playing the bass? I have my own theory for this also, and if you like I 
can explain.</p>
<p><strong>Please do!</strong><br>
OK. I do not make any publications or articles, and so this could be a 
good chance to explain myself. I always say to new people coming to me 
to study, that playing with the harp on the left-shoulder was the way it
 was played, that it was the tradition in the old days. So if you play 
on the left shoulder, wonderful. My explanation for this particular way 
of playing – resting the harp on the left shoulder – is not a technique 
that is demanded by the instrument in itself. It can equally well be 
played on the right side also. Instead, I believe that playing on the 
left shoulder started with musicians from the lyre tradition. I’ll try 
to explain this. As we can see on stone crosses for instance, we know 
that before the triangular harp was created, say a thousand years ago, 
the stringed instrument in Ireland and in Scotland was the lyre. For 
centuries, in a hereditary way within a family, that was the stringed 
instrument that professional musicians were playing. How? As in Greece 
and everywhere. As you know a lyre is an instrument with a U-shape. It 
has more or less seven strings. So it is natural for a right handed 
person to hold one arm of the lyre with the left hand and to pluck the 
strings with the right hand. This means that in a natural way, the lyre 
is resting on the left side of the body as you play.</p>
<p>So now, you need to imagine a lyre player. Let’s say in the south of 
Ireland, around Cork. During many previous generations in the family, 
actually for centuries, they were playing the lyre the way I was saying.
 But now imagine one day a person suddenly arrived to the south of 
Ireland with a new instrument, the harp. This new instrument was 
probably smaller than this 15th century Lamont instrument, and probably 
with less strings. So the natural answer to the new triangular 
instrument was to hold the instrument by the pillar with the left hand 
and rest it on the left side of the body while using the right hand to 
play perhaps sixteen strings or so. Over the years the harps were 
increasing in size and number of strings, but they kept playing in that 
position, and naturally if you are holding the harp on the left the next
 thing to do if you use two hands is to use the left hand for the 
treble, and the right hand for the bass. In playing the harp on the left
 shoulder it would be impractical or illogical to use the right hand for
 the treble and the left for the bass. Likewise, on the right shoulder 
would be unnatural to use the left for the treble and the right for the 
bass. So the position of the hands is determined by the shoulder you’re 
playing on, and that shoulder, in this case the left, is determined by a
 tradition of centuries of lyre players who used the left side of their 
bodies to rest the lyre on.</p>
<p>Most probably the first harp players in Ireland also played the lyre.
 Or if not, they abandoned the lyre just as they adopted the new 
instrument. So they were musicians changing their instrument but not 
their profession. It was only natural for them to keep playing the new 
instrument resting on the same shoulder. And as you know Irish 
traditional culture is very conservative in the good sense of the word. 
So if something was working they kept it that way – in this case playing
 on the left.</p>
<p>Regarding recovering the old technique, the point I made earlier is 
worth repeating. Any technique has to be demanded by the instrument. For
 example, the early Irish harp has metal strings, and that means we need
 fingernails to play. The spacing between the strings is such that we 
are not going to play as we would the classical harp. Instead we adopt 
this more natural hand shape with the fingers pointing directly to the 
strings. Metal strings mean the sound will sustain for a long time, so 
we also need the technique of selective damping. So the answer to many 
technical questions comes directly from the instrument.</p>
<p>All that said, the instrument in itself does not insist, does not 
demand of any player “you have to play me on the left or on the right”. 
This is a secondary question. It is a cultural approach to the 
instrument. The fact that you are playing on the left doesn’t mean that 
you are playing better. You’ll be a good player if you follow the 
technical demands of the instrument and if you keep yourself close to 
the musical style – ornaments, arrangements, etc. – of the repertoire.</p>
<p>The instrument is created to produce music, and what I want to hear 
is the music. If it is beautiful music. I don’t mind if it is played on 
the left or right shoulder. At least that is my approach. So I explain 
all this to all my new students – the tradition is to play on the left. 
If you play on the left, wonderful – I will admire this – though 
obviously it is more difficult for a right handed person. But it doesn’t
 mean you are going to play better. It means that your approach to the 
instrument is following that cultural tradition. So that is my way to 
look at this second mystery.</p>
<h2>TUNING</h2>
<p><strong>One of the big questions I have relates to tuning. Playing 
fiddle music you tune the four strings on your fiddle as best you can, 
and you can adjust the intonation of the notes as you go through the 
piece so that you are in tune. But on the early Irish harp, you set the 
tuning at the beginning of the tune.</strong><br>
It is different, based on the nature of the instrument.</p>
<p><strong>Lets say you are playing a piece, how do you decide from the start, how do you set up, how do ensure your harp is in tune?</strong><br>
Well, first of all there are many strings, so it is always work to tune 
the harp. It is certainly more complicated than the fiddle, with its 
four strings. Funnily enough, at the beginning of the 17th century in 
England, the time of King James I of England (also known as King James 
VI of Scotland), the British flag was first created with four quarters, 
four different objects representing each nation. The harp was selected 
as the symbol of Ireland. That was met with a lot of opposition from 
some parts of the aristocracy, because they didn’t like to have a harp 
on the flag. Apparently one of the more light-hearted reasons given – to
 provide comic relief – was that it took longer to tune the harp than to
 conquer the land!</p>
<p>Tuning an early Irish harp is much more complicated to tune than say a
 gut strung Renaissance harp. This is because of the metallic nature of 
the strings. If you have a Renaissance harp out of tune, you tune it, 
and that’s it. But with an early irish harp, if all strings are a little
 low, you tune it and you will have to tune it again! It will still come
 down in pitch, so you will likely need to tune again!</p>
<p>The first step in learning to tune is to develop the ear and to know 
when something is out of tune. This means the level of perfection in the
 tuning develops with the ears of the musician.</p>
<p>Then it is good to concentrate on the central octave, tuning the 
notes one by one, and with intervals. From there working in octaves 
toward the bass or the treble. And then checking also the octaves of the
 bass strings related to the treble. Then checking by playing chords all
 through the range of strings because sometimes these chords are in tune
 here in one register, but not in another.</p>
<p>In any case, it is important to know that the stability of the tuning
 depends a lot on temperature and humidity. That is why for a concert it
 is highly recommended for the harp to be in place well in advance to 
settle, and tuning there.</p>
<p>All that said, there is no perfect system of tuning on a harmonic 
instruments like the harp or the piano. On a melodic instrument this 
problem doesn’t exist but on a harp or a piano you play at the same time
 different notes on different intervals so a compromise or adjustment 
has to be made. Modern Equal Temperament started systematically with 
Bach and Couperin during the first half of 18th century. However there 
are other, earlier systems of tuning. Personally, I use the mean tone 
system, the most used in the 16th/17th centuries.</p>
<p><strong>Can you explain more about this mean tone system? When you 
mention the historical context of the music being important, I think the
 historical context of tuning is something that is also worth 
understanding when you are learning or arranging these pieces.&nbsp;</strong><br>
The mean tone system was created in the Renaissance, because the new 
thing then was the massive use of the third to create what we understand
 today as a chord. By chord, I mean the combination of a note along with
 the third and fifth above that note. That third of the chord was not 
used in the middle ages where they prefer to play fifths and fourths and
 in fact that third sounds quite dissonant in the Pythagorean tuning 
system employed in that period. Instead this Pythagorean system gives 
you perfect fifths and fourths. However for the modern harmony that was 
starting to develop in the Renaissance, the third was fundamental. The 
mean tone system was taking great care with the third, in giving a pure 
third, and sixth. So it all depends. Then Bach and Couperin arrived at 
the beginning of the 18th century with the conclusion that Equal 
Temperament was the best – all semitones exactly the same. In this way 
nothing is pure except the octave.</p>
<p><strong>What you’re saying about developing your ear, that is the main point, isn’t it?</strong><br>
It is. It is, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>And listening to the instrument itself</strong><br>
Yes, the tuning by octaves is the best. Sometimes when tuning in the 
bass if I play the note not with the nail but with the flesh, it gives a
 more rounded sound. So it is a question that develops with your ear, 
with your capacity. Of course there are people who have this gift, they 
have this pure ear to detect the tone of a mosquito flying – they can 
say “that’s F sharp”!</p>
<p><strong>I think it is important that you have touched on Equal 
Temperament, and then talking about mean tone systems, and Pythagorean 
systems. Because we have grown up with Equal Temperament. Pianos in 
Equal Temperament are considered “in tune”, but they’re not – instead 
all notes are equally out of tune. So it may be helpful to understand 
that our ears have been trained to a different system, probably less 
appropriate to the early Irish harp.</strong></p>
<p>I started playing with the Equal Temperament tuning but I was not 
happy for I was listening other early music players, though not 
particularly on the harp, and I could here there beautiful chords, very 
pure compared to the normal system. Happily some years ago, Siobhán 
Armstrong helped me to definitively move over to the mean tone system. 
Of course the piano sounds good – it’s a compromise and I don’t want to 
sound snobbish – it’s wonderful. But the only thing that is pure on 
modern instruments with Equal Temperament are the octaves, everything 
else is moved a little as you were saying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>MANUSCRIPT &amp; PRINTED SOURCES</h2>
<p><strong>Another area which would be interesting to touch upon is the 
sources of the early Gaelic, or early Irish and Scottish harp music. 
Could you talk about the Neal collection – how you first discovered it? </strong></p>
<p>John and William Neal’s publication in 1724 in Dublin was the first 
printed collection of Irish music. And still to me it is the best 
printed source because it was made at a time when harpers were still 
around. This is very important. We have a similar case with the Scottish
 lute manuscripts from the first half of the 17th century. Those 
manuscripts were written while the harp was being played in Scotland. So
 this means the harp tunes that are contained in the Scottish lute 
manuscripts were heard directly from the harp players just like Bunting 
at the Belfast harp meeting in 1792 and his sessions with Denis 
O’Hampsey. But yeah, the John and William Neal publication of Irish 
music is a little collection, but there are many harp tunes there. Just 
the melodies though, with no bass.</p>
<p>And then the other fundamental source in early Irish harp music is 
Bunting – not the printed books, but the manuscripts which have no piano
 arrangements imposed yet, and are more faithful to the original music 
heard from the living harpers.</p>
<p>Those are the main sources though we have sources in Scotland and 
Ireland from lets say the end of the 16th to the end of the 18th century
 – that is 2 centuries. What I want to make clear here is that during 
these two centuries, the style of the music was changing. If we take the
 lute tradition, for example the very famous English lute player John 
Dowland at the beginning of the 17th century, we could see that the 
music he was playing has nothing to do in style with let’s say Sylvius 
Leopold Weiss and others lute players in Germany during the first half 
of the 18th century. The style is completely different, but it is the 
same tradition and basically the same instrument modified in size and 
number of strings.</p>
<p>What I mean is that if you take music from Rory Dall Ó Catháin – the 
Irish harper at the beginning of the 17th century – the three or four 
tunes we know were composed by him have nothing to do in style with 
Carolan music. But it does not mean that Carolan music is inferior – no,
 it is the same tradition, but in a different moment – the style is 
changing, but there remain things in common too. Some people think that 
Rory Dall Ó Catháin music is the real thing and that Carolan has baroque
 influences and so is inferior somehow – no, it is all <em>cláirseach</em>
 music, but the style is changing, it is not always the same. So if we 
are working with 18th century sources, it is very good to have knowledge
 of the Baroque music language because it was an influence on the music 
of Carolan and others like Cornelius Lyons. So it helps if you have an 
ear and a knowledge of the Baroque style played on the continent and 
also in Ireland because here purely Baroque music was played too.</p>
<p><strong>What period of music influences your minimal approach to accompaniment the most?</strong><br>
In general I always like to say that the music of the early Irish harp –
 and it’s the same in Scotland – is very melodic, and the bass could be 
understood as a kind of ornament to the melody, an effective way to 
sustain and give more meaning to the melody.</p>
<p>If you take Carolan tunes from the wonderful Dónal O’Sullivan 
collection published in the 1950s, you’ll find there a lot of melodies 
that need to be arranged and for that you would need to have a sense of 
harmony. If you play just the melody it is very easy, I think, to find 
the chords. Especially for O’Carolan tunes which are more Baroque in 
style, or using major and minor scales, which are the basis for our 
modern musical language, not different from the Beatles or John Lennon.</p>
<p>So from the melody it is very easy to find the chords and many 
players often arrive at the same chord – I mean “that’s the chord!”. For
 purely modal music it is a different language. So the first thing to 
ask is “what are the bones of this melody?”. It may be a major / minor 
tune, or it could be a modal tune in Dorian or Mixalydian, etc. In the 
first case it helps a lot to have Baroque or classical harmony teaching.
 I always teach my students to know this difference, to be able know how
 it is the inner scale that sustains the melody and from there it is 
easier to start to work on the arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>So if you have a modal piece, how do approach the arrangement?</strong><br>
This early Irish harp is an instrument for which that famous phrase 
“less is more” is quite true. So you need to take care with ornaments. 
They are there to give more meaning and beauty to the melody. But if you
 use too many, you will destroy the whole thing!</p>
<p>So I have been reducing my use of ornaments, being more austere. That
 said I still use ornaments, because it is part of the tradition of the 
harp.&nbsp; But it is important not to become obsessed with the 
instrument in itself, forgetting that, beautiful as it is, it is just a 
medium. To remember that it is just a means to create music, which 
should always be the main aim.</p>
<p>If I take my own playing evolution – at the very beginning, in the 
1990s, I was very enthusiastically following something we knew at that 
time and that we still know, that ornamentation was very important with 
this music. And that is ok. But with time and experience I have reduced 
my focus on ornaments – not using them systematically throughout a 
piece, but only on the very important points of the melody.</p>
<p>Sometimes as musicians, we have a tendency to add many things, and in
 doing that we are concealing the melody. Of course you can take one 
tune and make many arrangements with different levels of difficulty – 
some easy, some more complicated. Sometimes the easier arrangements are 
the best, just like with ornamentation – being overly complex can 
destroy the expression of the melody.</p>
<p>Very often – and this is the same with Scottish music – the bass it 
is just a duplication of the important points or notes in the melody, 
playing an octave or two below. Or perhaps a fifth or a tenth below. 
That is all you need, basically. Then you can play with some ornaments 
on the accented points of the melody as we do when we speak. It is a 
work of spirit. When you arrive at something that works, you know it. 
Sometimes an arrangement can take years, other times you can make an 
arrangement in two days, and that’s just how it is.</p>
<p>For example, I have been playing Molly McAlpin by Connellan for two decades, and it has kept changing.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/297666596.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
Now I think I have arrived at the final arrangement, with which I am 
completely happy, but you never know! &nbsp;Because you keep finding new
 things in the technique, new ways of damping, new fingerings. So the 
arrangements keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned a few core sources – Neal and Bunting. Are 
there any others that you look at , that you would recommend for early 
Irish wire-strung harp music?</strong><br>
There are other sources but the most fundamental, without which nothing 
else would be possible, are Bunting manuscripts and John &amp; William 
Neal. A piece I often play is the second one listed in the Neal 
Collection, called <em>Clergy’s Lamentation</em>.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/297667476.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
But apart from sources, for a musician who wants to recover an 
instrument, it is essential in my opinion to be aware and to enjoy not 
only the music, but everything related to that period. To get involved 
in poetry, history – all that helps because you become really immersed 
in that period, in that sensibility. To bring alive the melody you have 
in front of you on paper. It is an essential background, to me. The same
 applies to Scotland – to listen to other instruments and traditions. In
 Scotland for instance the pipes have many things in common in the 
language.</p>
<h2>Composing new pieces in the old tradition</h2>
<p><strong>Javier, I know you have thoughts on composing new pieces to 
add to the body of old music in the manuscripts. Can you elaborate on 
this?</strong><br>
I think perhaps we are over-focussing exclusively on the original 
sources. But I also believe that if you get a deep understanding of this
 tradition and if you feel like composing something new – being sure 
that you are following the style – why not work in that direction to 
create such new music? In this emerging revival of the old tradition, I 
think that could be a step for the next generations. Not only to recover
 – &nbsp;the whole work we have been doing in last 30 years, the 
technique, the sources and all that – but also, with all that knowledge,
 to create new tunes that follow the tradition of the instrument. That 
would be a very interesting thing to do! And that would make the 
instrument more alive.</p>
<p>In this the early Irish harp is different from the lute. We have lute
 music from the beginning of the 16th century to the end of the 18th but
 the lute was an instrument not related to any particular country or 
tradition. Its music was purely court-like music. So when the social 
context was over in the 18th century, that was it.</p>
<p>Then in the 20th century some musicians wanted to recover the lute, 
and they played old historical lute music, but they stopped short of 
creating new music because it wouldn’t make sense, it would be a mere 
exercise. However with the early Irish harp it is different because the 
instrument is inside a musical tradition that has never been completely 
cut and the proof for this is that the original early Irish harp music 
doesn’t sound ‘old’ to modern ears in the sense it does lute music. So 
it makes sense to start creating new music for the early Irish harp. To 
me it would not be something artificial – as long as you have all the 
knowledge and background.</p>
<p><strong>Have you composed new pieces in the old tradition yourself?</strong><br>
Yes I have, several. I’ll give you an example to demonstrate what I mean by composing within the old tradition.</p>
<p>This is an easy-going tune called Dunvegan’s Air. Dunvegan is a 
castle on the north-west of the Isle of Skye. It was the seat of the 
MacLeod clan. Supposedly the last harper in the 18th century was the 
harper of that castle, Rory Dall Morrison.</p>
<p>So this tune is inspired by that landscape, seascape also. It also 
has a little Irish taste, but is is more inspired by the Scottish 
landscape. It is a tune that comes directly from the heart. What else 
can I say? That’s it …[music].<br>

<strong><br>
Thanks for sharing all your insights and music Javier! Can you play us out with another one of your own compositions?</strong><br>
OK. This is a piece call <em>McKenna’s Air and Variations</em>. It is 
named after a student of mine, and it is in the Scottish píobrach style,
 with a ground or theme, and variations. The full piece is almost ten 
minutes long, so I will play a sample from the beginning …[music]…<br>

and from the last variation and ground …[music].<br>
