		<h1><strong>Siobhán Armstrong</strong></h1>
<h2>“Singing is integral to this early Irish harp tradition because so 
much of the music is vocal. We’ve got to be thinking about it if we’re 
serious. This is as important as getting the right instrument and 
putting the right strings on it and looking at the correct hand position
 and the historical technique. This is as important, this is a part of 
the story. You can’t ignore it. Because otherwise you’ve got the right 
instrument and everything but you still don’t have the music, because 
the music is the words. <em>Abair amhrán. Abair amhrán. Abair amhrán ar an gcláirseach</em>, you know. <em>Sin é</em>. [Speak the song. Speak the song. Speak the song on the harp, you know. That’s it.]”</h2>

<h2><strong>Words &amp; images: Mícheál Ó Catháin</strong></h2>
<p>Recorded in October 2017, published on michealocathain.com in April 2019.</p>
<h2>Siobhán Armstrong has an unerring compass for what is authentic, 
equally so in early Irish music as in European art music. She demands 
serious appreciation for the nuances of what makes the early Irish harp 
and its associated song tradition beautifully unique, while at the same 
time recognising its inter-connectedness with other musical traditions 
over many centuries. I admire greatly Siobhán’s curiosity for learning 
and her deeply held principles, which guide not just her own musical 
journey but all – like myself – who are fortunate enough to come into 
her orbit.</h2>

<h2><strong>JOINTURE &amp; JIGG</strong></h2>
<p><strong> Mícheál Ó Catháin:<br>
Siobhán, to begin can you talk a little about the combination of the air – <em>the Jointure</em> – and the <em>Jigg</em>
 following it? Is this combination, a slow piece followed by a jig, 
something you have encountered often in an early music context – Irish 
and elsewhere?</strong></p>
<p>Siobhán Armstrong:<br>
Yes. This combination seems to be a thing that you come across – 
especially in a lot of the Carolan pieces – you get an air and you get a
 jig. Of course that’s not a uniquely Irish idea at all, because it’s an
 earlier European idea – you get pieces and jigs, like <em>Tanz und Nachtanz</em>
 in Germanic music. So it’s an earlier idea that moves forward, that you
 get a thing and the thing that’s related to it that goes afterwards. So
 that’s not uniquely Irish. But it’s lovely that in this kind of 
eighteenth-century Irish context we have these pieces that have jigs 
that are melodically related to them. In this case it’s very closely 
related to it.</p>
<p>So you – I think cleverly – suggested that this was a piece we could 
all work on to show, I suppose, the differences between the approaches, 
to have a snapshot of what we’re all doing right now, in 2017 and 2018, 
or whenever.</p>
<p><strong>I’m excited to hear your arrangement of the piece! Would you play it just now?</strong><br>
Sure …[music].<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/314018002.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about your arrangement choices?</strong><br>
The first choice to be made is what version of the piece do you play, 
and why. This piece occurs in the Bunting manuscripts – Bunting writes 
that he copied it down from the playing of Hugh Higgins in the early 
1790s but both the piece and the accompanying jig occur in his notebook 
among material he notates from Dennis O’Hampsey so it can’t be said, 
definitively, to be from Higgins. There’s also a version that shows up 
much earlier in 1724 in the first collection of Irish tunes ever to be 
published in Ireland – A Collection of the Most Celebrated Irish Tunes 
by John and William Neal. So there’s a version in there as well and the 
Neal version has one of the Irish titles, <em>A Stáraí ‘Ghoid mo Chlú-sa Uaim</em>,
 which roughly translates as ‘rude person who stole my reputation from 
me’. So it’s obviously from a woman’s point of view and it’s the old 
story that we all know. In Neal it is in some ways a Europeanised 
version – afterwards, it says, there is a ‘jigga’, a more italianate 
term, but the same old rhythm that we’ve all known since the Middle 
Ages: a compound duple rhythm.</p>
<p>So it was published in Neal in 1724, and then Bunting got it – called
 ‘The Jointure or Golden Star by Connellan’ – but Bunting then gives the
 Irish title down at the bottom as <em>Era ‘Ghadaí Ghoid mo Shláinte Uaim</em>
 so here it translates as ‘the thief who stole my health from me’, so a 
slightly different title. Much further in the notebook that Bunting 
starts in Belfast in 1792, he gives the jig. The two are separated in 
the notebook – they don’t occur together.</p>
<p>The first thing you notice about the piece is that it’s the usual 
thing we expect with an Irish tune, as in ‘it’s the tune’. But of course
 there’s more going on in the Bunting manuscripts in that sometimes you 
get bass indications. So in the second half of this tune you get a 
little hint. In the first half it’s only the tune, so we have no idea 
what the bass will play, and that’s the thing that’s of enormous 
interest to me and is my research work these years. Well I suppose it 
has been my research for a long time but now it’s my official research 
work as part of the PhD I am doing, or the main thrust of the PhD – what
 did the bass hand do? So if we look at the second half of the tune we 
see the little capital B for ‘bass’ that Bunting sometimes uses to 
indicate what the bass hand is playing. And we also have an idea because
 the stems go up and down in the manuscript. So in the second half of 
the tune, I knew that straight away I would be doing …[music]… so you 
have what sounds like …[music]… so, jumping around all over the place.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325102409.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
That’s with the stems up, this bit …[music]… the [E , G] is with the 
stems down, and he writes ‘B’, so I think he means bass …[music]… and 
then he has treble …[music]… and then he has this with a B in the bass. 
So you may ask why am I not doing that an octave lower than he indicates
 – I mean I’ve done this one an octave higher – he has indicated here 
…[music] and I’ve played it here …[music]. If he indicates here 
…[music]… why am I not playing down there …[music]? So let’s have a 
listen, maybe I should have done …[music]. That could be. But I think 
from looking at these pages now for a long time, I think it’s expedient 
for Bunting, if he can easily notate something at pitch, he does. It’s 
easy to write that [B] and the [D] there underneath the stave …[music]. 
But the [E, G] that’s very tricky – now you’re into lots of ledger lines
 for that bottom E. So I think that’s why he writes it up there 
…[music]… because it’s just too difficult to write it down here 
…[music]… but he means it down there. So he means this …[music]… this is
 already an octave lower. I find the two octave thing maybe a bit 
implausible …[music]… so I think it is here …[music].</p>
<p>They are the only two bass hand indications we have in the piece, and
 then after that we’re on our own. We have to try and figure out what to
 do. So how on earth do you figure out what to play on a bass hand where
 there is nothing given in the manuscript? So that’s the question for 
us!</p>
<h1>BASS-HAND EVIDENCE IN THE BUNTING DRAFT MANUSCRIPTS</h1>
<p>You need to be looking at every source of information you can 
possibly get your hands on. In the Bunting manuscripts themselves there 
is a lot of information about bass hand, and many little bass hand 
indications. When I was playing the modern Irish harp as a child, the 
general story on the block was “oh you know, the music is in the mists 
of time, we have no idea really how all that worked, there’s nothing 
left and we couldn’t possibly ever hope to go there.” And you think, 
“well yes and no”. It’s a broken tradition – so it ends shortly after 
1800, depending on how you define the end of the tradition – it’s 
somewhere in the early nineteenth century. So it’s a broken tradition 
and we cannot know, but there’s lots of information that we can have a 
look at. So I’ve been looking, over the last few years, looking in a 
very concentrated way at Bunting’s draft versions of the tunes. Because 
of course they’re the ones that are of primary interest – there’s no 
point really in looking at his published work, that’s Victorian piano 
music. There is some point I suppose in looking at his manuscript piano 
arrangements. Because the earlier ones – he starts getting more and 
more, how would you say, ‘flouncy’ as he goes, his arrangements become 
more and more action-packed as he goes through his life – but the 
earlier ones, I think there is something to be gleaned from harper 
performance practice in those.</p>
<p><strong>Is that because these piano arrangements were earlier and so closer to the actual time he sat with the harpers?</strong><br>
Yeah, I think it is several things. I think you’re right on the money. I
 think it’s that maybe he remembers better. But I think it’s also that 
his heart was in the right place – he really wanted to show what the 
harpers were doing, but he may have been pushed a bit by his publisher, 
or maybe by market forces, or a desire to conform with European music. 
That he maybe wanted to show – later on – how sophisticated it could be.
 So we can guess at the reasons why his reconstructions or arrangements 
got more complex. But in the early days I think it’s possibly much 
closer to what the harpers were doing.</p>
<p>But this is still the closest you can get, given that there are no 
primary sources for early Irish harp music. So obviously the harpers 
don’t need to write anything down in that way that most musicians in the
 world, in all traditions, don’t need to write it down. Because why 
would you? It’s all in your head. Our tradition is a medieval music 
tradition and of course in the Middle Ages lots of things didn’t get 
written down. It would be almost embarrassing to write it down. That 
would mean there’s something defective with your memory, and the memory 
was the thing. We know from from Bardic poetry how important it was that
 everything was memorised – it got written down only sometimes. And we 
know in general European terms about the ‘memory palace’, that it was a 
mark of pride that you would have everything memorised. So it was almost
 a failing to have to write things down.</p>
<p>Of course the fact that most of our harpers were blind mitigates 
against them writing things down anyway. They were tying into maybe an 
earlier aesthetic and performing tradition.</p>
<p><strong>Was the Jointure in the early manuscripts or not? I’m just 
trying to ascertain how much information you can glean from manuscript 
33 or are you going right back to manuscript 29 exclusively?</strong><br>
The Jointure is published in the 1796 volume. So that’s the thing. This 
is published within four years of Bunting hearing it. So that’s got to 
be important. He gives just those two bass hand indications in the 
second half. So for all the rest of it, you better be looking around 
yourself within that draft notebook to see if there’s anything else you 
can glean.</p>
<p>And so I’ve been gleaning for quite a while, and if it’s of interest 
to you I can share with you maybe the bass hand evidence that I’ve come 
up with so far from the draft notebooks.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, absolutely!</strong><br>
So it would seem to me that you can start to categorise the different 
kinds of bass hand evidence that you see in the manuscript. If you can 
do that then maybe you can start to utilise it in pieces like this that 
don’t have bass hand. So that’s basically what I was trying to do for 
you there when I was playing the piece – to utilise the information that
 I’ve gleaned from other pieces that do have bass.</p>
<p><strong>So that allows you to interpret, for example, what an up-staff or down-staff indicates?</strong><br>
Well yeah, I mean the more you look at the manuscripts the more you’re 
going to become familiar with them and the more you’re going to be able 
to glean out of them, that’s for sure.</p>
<p>So the first shocking thing for a European musician – or I suppose 
for anybody familiar with European music who looks at the manuscripts – 
is that because he’s writing down music in the eighteenth century you 
might expect this music to have a bass-line, because of course music all
 around Europe in the seventeenth- and eighteenth centuries was built 
from the bottom up. The bass was the basis of everything, to the extent 
that you had bass improvisation patterns. You’d have riffs that you 
could improvise tunes over, or variations / divisions on melodies. And 
so it was very ‘bass-centered’.</p>
<p>But this music seems to be exactly the opposite. And maybe we 
shouldn’t be surprised because it’s coming from a medieval place, not 
from a seventeenth- and eighteenth century place. In the Middle Ages the
 tune was paramount – certainly in less sophisticated music – because of
 course you find polyphony, multi-voice music in the medieval period – 
but for compositions like this, it tends to be melody-based and the bass
 isn’t so important at all. Even all the way into the fifteenth century,
 if you look at some of the earliest keyboard music, the bass isn’t 
quite there yet. So I think we’re still channeling that older aesthetic 
even in the later centuries.</p>
<p>This is a piece by the composer Thomas Connellan, who was born in the
 seventeenth century. Of course we don’t know exactly how it sounded 
then because Bunting heard it in the eighteenth century. Bu the first 
thing you notice in his draft notebooks is that there’s not much 
independent bass underpinning the melody. There isn’t much evidence for 
standard European harmony either, though of course the fact that we’re 
not seeing it isn’t necessarily evidence of absence. So it’s hard to 
know what you can safely deduce, and what you can’t.</p>
<p>There is ample evidence in the manuscript of compositional style that
 doesn’t follow the European rulebook. So we see lots of parallel 
octaves and things like that, even some parallel fifths. That is seen as
 an error in European music – you’d call the grammar police for that! – 
because it’s not okay at all to have parallel octaves. But in a Medieval
 context in European music that wouldn’t be a problem at all, and in an 
Irish context it’s clearly what was happening. Bunting wouldn’t add that
 as a sort of a fictional add-on, because for him it’s an error. So if 
he’s writing it down it’s because it’s what he’s hearing. It’s 
definitely not something that he’s making up.</p>
<p>The bass notes tend to be melody dependent rather than, as I say, 
following seventeenth- and eighteenth-century European practice, which 
is ‘bottom-up’. This tends to be ‘top-down’ – as in the bass notes often
 echo the melody notes. For example, in <em>Lady of the Desert</em> 
which Bunting notates – I’ll play you the actual bass line that’s in the
 manuscript …[music]… so the [g] keeps echoing the [G, g] and then 
followed by [E, B], [d] followed by [D,G] …[music].<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325101641.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
In the second half of the tune …[music]… [d] mirrored by [D] …[music]… 
[d] followed by [D, G] …[music]… [e] followed by [E, B] …[music]… [d] 
followed by [D, G] …[music]… so you get the idea – that the bass notes 
are coming out of the treble, that they’re echoing the treble, they’re 
mirroring the treble. And what you’re also seeing there is a good 
example of where the bass notes happen in gaps in the tune …[sings]. So 
there’s stuff happening in gaps, not necessarily under the notes. So 
that’s another thing that I’m seeing sometimes, that they’re filling in 
under longer melody notes and filling in on weak beats.</p>
<p>So the bass notes – of course, we see all the time, they sound in 
octaves with the melody, either on single notes or for more extended 
passages. The classic example there is possibly the oldest piece in the 
collection which is <em>Cumha Caoine an Albanaigh / Scott’s Lamentation </em> which was composed for the Baron of Loughmoe, who lived no distance from here in Co. Tipperary …[music]…<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325101388.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
So there we have a piece that frequently moves in octaves …[music]… he 
actually notates the treble and the bass …[music]… octave [D, A G], and 
so and so forth. So there are many examples of that kind of thing going 
on.</p>
<p>The bass notes themselves are sometimes doubled at the octave, you 
see that too. And you see the bass notes sometimes as broken octaves. 
Then you have all sorts of little bass riffs – we saw in <em>Lady of the Desert</em> you have two notes in the bass. Sometimes you have three notes or four notes in the bass.</p>
<p><strong>When you say doubling of the bass, is it that your bass hand is playing an octave?</strong><br>
Bunting shows that in his Graces chart in his 1840 volume – he gives a 
list of ornaments and bass hand patterns. He shows …[music]… octaves 
moving up<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325101028.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
the harp and moving down the harp. So that’s one piece of evidence that they were playing octaves with their bass hand.</p>
<p><strong>Is that what you mean by doubling the bass hand?</strong><br>
Yes, that’s what I mean. Sometimes the bass hand just doubles the treble
 …[music]… but sometimes it doubles it in octaves …[music]… so you get 
that going on as well.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned four notes possibly as well?</strong><br>
You have lots of pieces where that occurs. You have <em>Lady of the Desert</em> where you have …[music]… that kind of thing.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325100861.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
But then you have pieces like <em>Eibhlín a Rún</em> and one of the variations of it that O’Hampsey played, you have things like …[music]… in the bass, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>This was all news to me when I started looking. I thought “Oh there’s
 actually masses of evidence, there’s loads of evidence”, and you can 
categorize it. I was really surprised by that.</p>
<p>The piece that I generally start people off on when I’m talking about bass hand is <em>Táim i Mo Chodladh is Ná Dúisigh Mé</em>
 which is in [QUB Special Collections] MS 4.33.3, p. 57. That’s really 
interesting because Bunting says this setting is exactly copied “from 
Hempson, both bass and treble”. So of course we get wildly excited. But 
of course there are problems. Clearly I don’t think it’s all what 
O’Hampsey was playing. But there you do have an awful lot of …[music]…<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325099951.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
that kind of thing going on, so you can see the mirroring of treble and 
bass. [Music]… so you have [A, G, E] arriving in the gap, the same note 
as the treble – do you see these patterns emerging? It’s always the same
 thing. It’s the treble note …[music]… reiterated in the gap in the 
bass.</p>
<p>And then we have …[music]… parallel octaves. The second half is 
really interesting …[tuning, music]… so [F] mirrored in the bass, 
possibly as an octave. I mean this version in MS 4.33 is a piano 
arrangement, and he has an octave but it’s not completely unreasonable. 
[Music]… so again, [e, E]… [d, D] … and so on. That’s just yet another 
example of something that I’ve seen time and time again.</p>
<p>It may not be coincidental that a lot of these pieces were actually 
taken from the playing of Denis O’Hampsey. Of course he’s the one 
playing with the oldest style. You can’t extrapolate and say that 
they’re all playing this way. That’s a very important thing to say, 
because some of them – like Arthur O’Neill and Hugh Higgins and people 
like that – may well be trying to emulate pianos, they may well be 
putting in more European bass lines, it’s not clear to me.</p>
<p><strong>The version of the Jointure that you have played, I didn’t 
fully follow what you were saying about who it came from. We have it 
recorded from O’Hampsey, or do we know?</strong><br>
Bunting writes that it was taken from Hugh Higgins. But it’s in a part 
of [QUB Special Collections] MS 4.29, where there is a lot of O’Hampsey 
material, so it’s not clear to me which of them he got it from.</p>
<p><strong>O’Hampsey did play a Connellon piece, so he may have been aware of the Jointure if he didn’t play it himself?</strong><br>
Oh yeah, oh totally. O’Hampsey plays <em>Molly St. George</em>, which was also composed by Thomas Connellon.</p>
<p><strong>So it’s plausible to use techniques that are from O’Hampsey?</strong><br>
Well certainly because it is a seventeenth-century piece, so I don’t think it’s unreasonable to do that.</p>
<p>Here is a bit of <em>Eibhlín a Rúin</em> that has three notes in the 
bass. So it’s in the middle of one of the variations …[music]… bass, 
[c]…[C, G, C] …[music]… [b]… [G, D, G] , now that’s interesting because 
that’s harmonic, he plays b in the treble …[music]… so outlining 
harmony.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325741252.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Could you just explain that bass again – was that an example of four notes in the bass?</strong><br>
Three notes …[music]… so one, two, three …[music], just a riff that’s a bit longer in the bass.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325740953.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
<strong>It’s three notes, but two of them are at the same pitch?</strong><br>
Exactly, three different notes, but actually less complicated than that because as you point out, it’s only two pitches.</p>
<p><strong>It does seem to be a feature of the bass hand arrangements, 
that those kind of details are important. That even though you’re only 
playing two pitches, it’s three notes – and it does sound more complex 
or richer that you would think.</strong><br>
[Music]… absolutely, because you are setting up that resonance …[music]… and<br>
coming back to it.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325740611.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>So you have a Bob Jordan of Carolan – and at the end …[music]… so you have …[music]… and then you have whole patterns …[music]…<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325740039.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
So you start to have little melodic things in the bass …[music]… so 
that’s one, two, three, four …[music]… but again, he just outlines a 
third with a passing note and reiterates it, but it just lasts longer – 
four notes.</p>
<p>It’s only when you go looking for these patterns that you start finding quite a few of them. In <em>Sliabh Gallen</em> which O’Hampsey played – it’s a set of variations by Cornelius Lyons – you get a whole bass-hand variation …[music]…<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325739622.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
you get all that sort of stuff. We’re not expecting that at all – 
because once you’ve looked through the manuscript and it’s all melody, 
melody, melody, you give up hope. Then suddenly you find a whole bass 
hand division. And again it’s not coincidence because all those pieces 
are Lyons coming through O’Hampsey. So you have interesting bass-hand 
things happening in <em>Lady of the Desert</em> and <em>Cailíní, a’ Bhfaca Sibh Seoirse?</em>, the two variation sets that Lyons composes. And also in <em>Sliabh Gallen</em>.</p>
<p>So what I’m talking about now – two notes, three notes, four notes in
 the bass. Maybe it is an eighteenth-century thing because it shows up 
in Carolan pieces, it shows up in Lyons which is being channeled through
 O’Hampsey, and so – as I say – you finally get to that extended bass 
line that’s in Sliabh Gallen.</p>
<p><strong>Those two, three, four note bass lines, are they in the field notebook, MS 4.29, or do they appear more so in MS 4.33?</strong><br>
<em>Sliabh Gallen</em> is in MS 4.29. Generally, I only work from the MS
 4.33 books if there’s nothing relevant in MS 4.29. So there are one or 
two Carolan pieces like <em>Planxty Burke</em> which is in one of the MS
 4.33 books –the melody goes between the hands, and I might show you 
that in a second, but generally I would always try and work from the 
best secondary source I can which are the drafts in MS 4.29 and in other
 places. But I try not to work from keyboard versions unless there’s no 
draft extant. Sometimes there isn’t even a piano arrangement extant, 
like for Carolan’s Concerto – there are only two printed versions, in 
the 1796 and 1809 volumes. There’s no draft, so obviously there are 
notebooks missing.</p>
<p>Remember Lyons is an eighteenth-century musician – he’s the harper to
 the Earl of Antrim so he’s hearing absolutely normal European music – 
Corelli, Geminiani and others. So he is clearly composing in a quite a 
European way, at least meoldically. You can hear in <em>Lady of the Desert</em>, in the first variation …[tuning, music]…<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325737054.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
if you heard that played on a Baroque violin or a harpsichord you 
wouldn’t remotely associate it with Irish music …[music]… that’s just 
normal European music, but that’s composed by Lyons, so he’s completely 
­– in many ways – in the European vein. Except that of course he writes 
these other variations …[music]… that are highly ornamented, there are 
ornaments signs indicated, that are clearly not particularly European. 
And again you see the usual thing of ..[music]… a gap, which echoes the 
treble …[music]… I think that’s in the manuscripts, that it echoes it at
 the octave …[music]… so again it’s all, I think, broadly speaking to 
one place.</p>
<p>We talked about <em>Planxty Connor</em>. There is no draft of this 
and so I have to work from a piano arrangement manuscript. But this to 
me points up why we should all – if we’re interested in getting as close
 to Carolan as we can when we’re performing his music – it behoves us to
 look at drafts and piano arrangement manuscripts and not what is often 
the case, which is that many versions of Carolan tunes that we hear are 
not taken from harp sources at all. So most, if not all, harpists for 
example, play a version of Carolan’s Concerto that is taken from Francis
 O’Neil’s early twentieth-century collection in Chicago. But if we have 
harp sources available to us – because this is I think how I started out
 this conversation with you – which version? There are different 
versions of The Jointure. Which one would you play? Well for me, 
obviously, I would play the one that Bunting collected because that’s 
going to be the closest I can get to a harp version. Rather than say 
playing the Neal version from 1724 which is not necessarily from a harp 
source at all. Even though there’s lots of harp music in that 
collection, it has not necessarily been taken directly from harpers. 
Because those tunes were played by other people – possibly fiddle 
players and so on.</p>
<p>If you look at <em>Planxty Connor</em>, we’re used to this tune being played …[music]… that’s just the normal version of <em>Planxty Connor</em>. But if you look at his manuscript piano arrangement …[music]…<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325099540.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
… so in fact Carolan was always playing around, splitting up things 
between the hands. So if at all possible I would always say “try and 
find a version of Carolan tunes in the Bunting manuscripts first”. That 
happens also at the end …[music]… really interesting, really lively, 
really vibrant if you do that.</p>
<p><strong>So that gives me a brilliant overview of bass hand evidence, 
and you have brought all of that to bear when you approached the Bunting
 version of the Jointure.</strong><br>
I hope I have. I suppose the only other thing to say about the bass 
hand, is that you see an alternating treble and bass idiom. So sometimes
 you get it note by note. In some of the tunes it goes 
treble–bass–treble–bass–treble–bass, in a few places. Sometimes it’s 
more antiphonal – it’s sort of motif by motif – like we’ve just seen in <em>Planxty Connor</em>,
 you know – it’s between the two hands, antiphonally, one side and then 
the other. Or sometimes you get extended division of material between 
the hands, phrase by phrase, in a lot of the Carolan pieces. And then of
 course there are pieces where you do get chords, and they tend not to 
be the I / ii/ V chords that we hear in a lot of European harping where 
you have this kind of thing …[music]…<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325099042.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
They tend to be wider-spaced chords …[music]… and there are a collection
 of those that Bunting notates in his Graces chart in his 1840 
publication, so you can have a look at bass-hand possibilities there. 
But they tend to be compound intervals. So rather than having G and B 
together …[music], the B would be a tenth apart rather than a third 
…[music], which of course sounds much nicer …[music]… it’s much more 
sonorous than having that …[music]… that sort of thing.</p>
<p>And I’m arpeggiating down because that’s what the harpers told Bunting, that “you don’t arpeggiate up, you arpeggiate down”.</p>
<p>But then you have these aberrations like Féachain Gléis, the ancient 
prelude that O’Hampsey plays for Bunting. There you have really big 
chords. So you have …[music]… and so on, so a full-scale chordal thing, 
but maybe not in such a modern way.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325098845.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Ann Heymann was the first person to point out that this is the kind 
of thing you see in the first keyboard music that’s notated in Europe, 
so you see it in organ books in Germany, where you have basically 
something happening in the bass and then you have other stuff happening 
on top, then something else happening in the bass, and something 
happening on top. So again that’s not a particularly Irish idea, it’s 
probably a pan-European prelude idea.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you land Siobhán, on the upward and downward arpeggio for this piece? Because there is evidence for both.</strong><br>
Well Bunting notates all this going up …[music]…<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325097686.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
and then he neatly contradicts himself when he talks about it and he 
tries to shove the blame on someone else! He says “oh, the publisher got
 this wrong. We know these chords are all supposed to be played down, so
 that was really the publishers fault”. And you think “well yeah, wait a
 minute. Let’s look back at all the draft versions then, and the piano 
arrangements and the published versions and have a look around them”. 
And it seems to me, at the moment – I mean, I’ve changed my opinion on 
this – but I seem to be more consistently on one side of this argument 
than the other these days, which is that I think he notated them up 
because he heard them up. It seems to me, that for a musician like 
Bunting, it’s not much of an argument to say “well they were so quick he
 couldn’t tell”, or “he wasn’t capable of writing them down”, or all the
 arguments I’ve heard to suggest ambiguity or that they should be played
 going down. In all of his drafts ­– from the earliest all the way to 
the MS keyboard versions – he writes them going up, and he published 
them going up. I think he realizes he’s slightly contradicting himself 
because the harpers have said that they play them going down, so he 
doesn’t want to be seen to be at odds with what they say. So I suspect 
that that’s what’s going on – that he’s trying to cover his tracks at 
the end, saying “oh that was somebody else’s fault, they’re really 
supposed to be down”. And the clincher for me is that at the very end of
 <em>Féachain Gléis</em> …[music]… in the very last chord it goes 
…[music]… Bunting is perfectly capable of writing them down, he writes 
that one going down. So if you can write that one going down, he could 
have written the other ones going down, but he chose not to. And so that
 tells me that he didn’t hear them going down, they were going up. 
Because he has both directions in the same piece. He notates things 
going up and then, at the very end, he notates something going down 
…[music]. So at the moment I think the chords that he notates going up, 
they were played going up – and the ones that he notates going down , 
they were going down. But I might change my mind on that – it’s a 
snapshot. This whole project for you is a snapshot. That’s where I sit 
on that argument at the moment.</p>
<p>So that just gives you some gist of what I’m seeing with the bass hand patterns. The classic case is of course <em>Carolan’s Concerto</em>, where the version that we know now – that I hear played – is the one from Francis O’Neill’s <em>Music of Ireland</em>
 collection in Chicago in the early twentieth century. So it’s …[music]…
 I can’t remember the usual version now – anyway it’s all in the treble 
hand.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325741671.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
And I always found that hard to play as a child, I sort of shied away from <em>Carolan’s Concerto</em>,
 because I thought “gosh, that’s exceptionally difficult”. And we know 
everybody says that Carolan wasn’t really such a good harper anyway. So 
you think “how do we square that with this really intricate stuff?”.</p>
<p>It’s only when you look at Bunting’s two published versions, you 
realise it’s …[music]… Again it’s antiphonal – it’s divided between the 
hands. And that’s entirely in keeping with what we see everywhere else 
in many Carolan tunes. So again it behoves us to get back to a more 
harpy version. I don’t really have a version of this under my fingers 
…[music]… I also don’t have enough notes on this harp …[music]… but that
 bit – that’s what I want to show you – that it’s antiphonal. The 
version that we hear of it nowadays is not showing us that. Again, you 
know, even if a draft version isn’t available, even if a MS keyboard 
version isn’t available, have a look then at the published version and 
see if you can learn something from that.</p>
<p>So I think that’s all I want to say to you about bass hand. There’s 
lots more to be said, but this will give you some sort of snapshot.</p>
<h1>ARRANGING <em>THE JOINTURE</em></h1>
<p>Anyway your basic question was “how do I arrange<em> the Jointure</em>?”
 So my answer to you would be that I’m utilizing all those things. I’m 
trying not to have an independent bass hand, I’m trying not to have 
harmony, I’m trying to be extremely conservative – maybe over 
conservative, you know, maybe my versions are too simple – but I just 
want to err on that side rather than the other side, because I’m sure, 
for a lot of my life, I erred on the other side. When I played modern 
Irish harp – and even when I started off playing early Irish harp – I 
probably still had lots more harmonic content in my playing.</p>
<p>I try to have the bass hand arise from the treble hand, so if the tune is …[music]…<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325096083.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
I could put a [G] in the bass …[music]… I could start off on a [G], but I
 start off by mirroring the [b] with a [B] …[music]… and then mirror the
 [g] with a [G]. Then we have [a] going to [G] …[music]… which kind of 
implies a cadence of dominant / tonic …[music]… so I’ll stick in the 
bare bones of a cadence …[music].</p>
<p>Now here we have …[music]… so you have nothing on beat two – great, 
that’s a place to put in a bass note …[music]… and now we have a / e, so
 again some sort of progression is required …[music]… so, dominant chord
 and just mirror the e …[music]. I suppose in standard European music 
that’s an interrupted cadence – it’s V going to vi. But I’m just 
mirroring the e.</p>
<p>[Music]… oh! We’ve got another gap – bass note …[music]… bass note 
…[music]… and then the bare bones of a cadence to get us to the end. So 
that’s the approach.</p>
<p>In the second half …[music]… I still have a [G] ringing from the first half, so I don’t harmonize the beginning …[music]…<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325094040.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
so it’s just sitting there with the pre-existing [G] …[music]… then the bass hand comes in …[music].</p>
<p>Then we have treble and so I’ll just mirror that with the bass hand – an [a] with an [A] …[music]… and that gives me a nice <em>voice-leading</em>
 from the [a] to the [b] …[music]… which [he / Bunting] indicates as 
bass …[music]… and then …[music]… sometimes I mirrored the [e] with an 
[E] …[music]… so I’m thinking this is an appoggiatura on a [d] …[music]…
 so it’s [e, d] …[music]… but you could as easily… and when I repeat it I
 think I played …[music]… [g, G], so you could keep going over a [G] 
drone.</p>
<p>Then we have seen …[music]… [c,d,e,f,g], so [C] under [c], [G] under 
[g]. And then carrying on …[music]… [e,d,c,c], [d,e,g,g], so [E] under 
[e], [C, B] under [b, G].</p>
<p>And second time round I think I was worried I was being too 
puritanical, so I think I gave you harmony! I think I put [C] under it, 
and that seems to me to be entirely plausible because the harmony is 
outlined in the triad above – [e,d,c] …[music]… so it’s sitting there, 
it’s not something I’m adding on. It’s integral to the melody, I’m just 
pulling it out of it.</p>
<p>And then the same procedure for the [b,a,g], [G] underneath it 
…[music]… and then …[music]… which we see all over the place in the 
manuscripts …[music]… so [g] mirrored by [G], [a] mirrored by [A], [b] 
mirrored by [B] …[music].</p>
<p>And then I was feeling very louche so I gave you more harmony! 
[music]… and that’s not a chord I use very often because I tend to avoid
 the sub-dominant. I tend to avoid this chord of IV like the plague, 
because I think they didn’t use it much …[music]. That’s the big 
question for me – how much did they use the sub-dominant, or how much 
did they not?</p>
<p><strong>Were you going to say it’s implied in the melody?</strong><br>
Yes, but it’s not because there isn’t a [c] in the melody, and the chord
 of the subdominant is the chord of C – [C, E, G]. So the melody has an 
[e], so my instinct is to harmonize it with the chord of E, the 
submediant. There are a few bits of text in Bunting where he talks about
 the fact that they liked the submediant, that they liked to use that 
rather than the more lush …[music]… that’s quite a lush harmony. So I 
almost never do it, but special treat – I thought I’d give just one 
little bit of harmony!</p>
<p>[Music]… so we’re back into that home tonality of G …[music]… something in the gap …[music]… and then a cadence.</p>
<p>So a very, very simple approach. I’m almost doing nothing. But I 
suppose the question is “do you feel the texture is lacking when you 
hear that?” And I don’t really feel like the texture is lacking because 
of the resonance of the instrument.</p>
<p>And also because then you have time to give some attention – if 
you’re not blasting away on some sort of complicated bass hand – you 
have time to give attention to the phrasing you’re going to use, to the 
kind of ornaments you’re going to use.</p>
<p>This is another thing we can pull out of this manuscript page – that 
Bunting gives us at least three or four examples of ornaments. …[music]…
 so he has …[music]… he has a trill sign up here …[music]… it depends 
what you think a trill is.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325093497.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
I mean it might be [g, a, g] but I’m not sure. Ornaments are very 
ambiguous in all of music at all times. I think they’re meant to be 
ambiguous – you’re not meant to nail them down. If you hear a good 
performer in any style of music, they’ll never really ornament the same 
way twice, will they? So I think it’s always ambiguous, like “well, he 
did a twiddle here”, or “he did something there”. That’s about as good 
as it’s going to get. I mean we can try and nail it down further but I’m
 not sure that’s really helpful. In this passage he has a little ‘t’ for
 an ornament sign …[music]… and there …[music]. So I’ve incorporated 
those in my playing.</p>
<p>The other thing …[music]… sometimes I put in an ornament …[music]…<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325092920.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
and I pulled that out of his published version – his 1796 version – he 
uses that twice. I don’t necessarily do it both times but that was a 
nice thing – not implausible. But I can’t vouch that Bunting didn’t make
 that up …[music]… but he might have heard it …[music].</p>
<p><strong>Is there a corresponding technique in the bass section of the Graces page in Bunting’s 1840 publication?</strong><br>
Not for that, no – he doesn’t give two-note ornaments. <em>Leagadh anuas</em>
 would be …[music]… just one note before it, and this is …[music]… which
 I don’t really see on the Graces pages. But still I don’t find that at 
all implausible. He notates triplets …[music]… and <em>three-note</em> ornaments are everywhere, you see them all over the place. So I’ve incorporated that.</p>
<p>I suppose there’s a question about where do I put my foot down in the
 bass – where do I put those bass notes? I tend, I suppose, to put them 
on strong beats, except where I’m putting things in gaps on off beats, 
because that’s what there’s lots of evidence for, rather than bass notes
 on strong beats.</p>
<h1>ARRANGING <em>THE JIGG</em></h1>
<p><strong>Can you talk about your arrangement of the <em>Jigg</em>?</strong><br>
Right let’s have a look at the <em>Jigg</em>. The <em>Jigg</em> is even simpler, there’s nothing going on there!</p>
<p>[Music]… this seemed to me to be kind of binary. There’s a G-ish 
thing going on …[music]… and then there’s an A-ish thing …[music].<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325092620.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
I suppose if you want to be really simple, you could just go …[music]… 
you could have a kind of ‘Gaelic two-chord trick’ thing going on – just 
going from G-major to A-minor …[music].</p>
<p>And you could be more complicated in the second line because you have
 an outline of …[music]… G, but then you have this …[music]…<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325092371.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
… so that could be the submediant – an A-ish thing. Or if you’re feeling
 very louche it could be a subdominant thing …[music] So it could be all
 of those – from not fruity at all, to very fruity.</p>
<p>But as I’ve played around with it …[music]…<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325092145.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
I went for the dominant / tonic option …[music]… but with lots of tonic 
…[music]. So G-chord until it doesn’t work, and then dominant D-chord. 
So tonic, and little bits of dominant, and that’s it really.</p>
<p>[Music]… again you could be more complicated, but I liked the simplicity.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325090994.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
Especially in a jig, where your hands have to trip along and you want to
 think about ornamentation. I didn’t want to do something complex in the
 bass.</p>
<p>[Music]… maybe that could have been a place to put in a note on an 
offbeat, like I’ve seen before …[music]… see now that you’re asking me 
about it I’m coming up with different ideas! That’s why it’s a snapshot!
 You see? Already what I played for you five minutes ago, it’s like 
that’s completely old hat, now I want to do this different stuff!</p>
<p><strong>That’s the freedom that having a sparse arrangement allows you.</strong><br>
That’s a very good point, yes – that I’m not wedded to anything. I can 
decide which octave that tonic …[music]… is going to be in, at a 
moment’s notice. So it probably meanders around each time.</p>
<p><strong>And it sounds completely different to me, just having the tonic in a different octave.</strong><br>
Oh really? You see I can’t sit outside myself and know what I’m doing, so that’s interesting feedback.</p>
<p><strong>That’s what I find is the richness of having all of those 
expanded ranges for the tonic. You are not confined to single octave or 
octave and a half. A very simple idea is that I can play a tonic chord, 
and the dominant, and I switch around the octaves I play them in.</strong></p>
<p>[Music]… yes, because I chose to be up here, it’s kind of ‘high-up’ 
territory …[music]… if you hang on and then give some bass later on, it 
is like ‘wow!’ – it adds a whole other layer.</p>
<p><strong>Because it’s a jig, it is more rhythmical than the first 
piece, the Jointure. Are you laying out the rhythm with your bass hand? 
Is that an important function of the bass hand?</strong><br>
OK that’s a good question …[music]… certainly if I do something dramatic
 like going down an octave or two, I’m going to do that at a very strong
 moment.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325090512.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
So it’s actually the beginning of the second phrase …[music].</p>
<p>Yes, and apart from that I suppose I’m just putting things on strong 
beats …[music]… you could put one there for example, you could go down 
an octave there. So I’m heading for landmark moments in the phrases, 
yes.</p>
<p><strong>How do you identify ‘landmark’ moments?</strong><br>
Ooh, how long is a piece of string?! I think that’s that thing that is 
called ‘embedded knowledge’ in the university context. You get a feel 
for it over the years. You get a sense of phrasing – you get a sense of 
contours in melodies, where you think things are going.</p>
<p>And then it’s sort of basic maths, because this is a jig that’s in four groups of four bars.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325090197.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
It’s a very metrical thing …[music]… one…two…three…four …[music]…<br>
that’s the end of your phrase …[music]… one…two…three…four …[music].</p>
<p>So there is all sorts of stuff that you figure out when you play 
music, that have what are often called ‘feminine endings’. So the last 
note in the phrase you’re not going to belt it out. That’s going to be a
 weaker thing because it’s the end of the phrase. And often composers – 
you can see they work with that idea – whoever composed this tune, that 
there’s a contour that goes down towards the end of the second phrase 
…[music]… it’s a sort of gentle ending.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325089613.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
<strong>I’m going to give you a chance to revise what you just said, because you just associated ‘female’ with ‘weak’!</strong><br>
[Laughing] I know! It’s really annoying! You see, I can’t think of how 
else to describe that because unfortunately the technical term is a 
‘feminine ending’, which is really annoying to me as a 
twenty-first-century woman. But I’m not going to get Orwellian and 
develop a new term, because everybody knows that term. But thank you for
 recognizing my dilemma Mícheál, I’m grateful!</p>
<p>So how do I know what the landmark moments are? It has to do with the
 contour of the melody, and it has to do with the harmonic structure. 
It’s really quite complicated. Every musician knows where those moments 
are, and they might not always be able to articulate it. It’s actually 
quite a sophisticated thing that goes on in some part of you.</p>
<p>[Music]… so if you look at that, the first bar goes [G] …[music]… 
second bar is [A] …[music]… [A]… [G]… so we have a hierarchy of 
[G,A,A,G] in those four bars.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325088632.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
So you have ‘home’, you have ‘somewhere else’, you have ‘somewhere 
else’, and you have ‘home’. So obviously you go for ‘home’ …[music]… 
that’s your first important beat …[music]… then you go for the one 
that’s different …[music]… and then it resolves to ‘home’ …[music]. And 
then it goes different again …[music]… and it resolves to ‘home’ 
…[music].</p>
<p>So generally ‘home’ is a place that doesn’t have tension, and 
‘somewhere else’ is a place that does have tension. So this …[music]… is
 fairly relaxed, then …[music]… oooh, we’re somewhere else …[music]… 
that gets our attention, and the resolution is weaker …[music]… 
stronger, weaker …[music]… and weak because it’s the end of a phrase. So
 that sets up my hierarchy for me.</p>
<p>So it’s sort of ‘home and away’. I think what piper Barnaby Brown and
 harpist Bill Taylor would call ‘home and away’ in that sort of ‘1 and 
0’ system that you see in parallel music traditions like the Welsh <em>Robert Ap Huw</em>
 manuscript. So you have tension and resolution, and so I’m going 
towards the tense places and I’m coming away from the resolutions.</p>
<p><strong>It’s plausible that it would be this kind of arrangement 
because this is a ‘jigg’, as opposed to a dance music jig. Can you talk a
 bit about the style of this ‘jigg’?</strong><br>
Oh! I don’t know. How do you see that difference? Because it’s not clear to me what the difference is.</p>
<p><strong>Well my understanding ­– and you might set me right…</strong><br>
Well you might set me right!<br>
<strong>…that these ‘jiggs’ were a style, or a thing in European music –
 that may have come in to Irish music – but that there is a whole set of
 tunes that were played slowly – slow airs – that followed into a 
quicker more rhythmic piece. I’m curious about this because it’s still 
something you see today in Irish traditional music. You’ll hear a piper 
play a slow air and they will then go straight into something faster – a
 jig or a reel. But what I understand is that that sort of jig or reel 
is different to what this ‘jigg’ is because you wouldn’t dance to this 
‘jigg’. That’s my differentiation – a ‘jig’ is a dance, and a ‘jigg’ is 
not.</strong><br>
Oooh, but you see maybe life isn’t binary. Maybe it’s not ‘a dance’ or 
‘not a dance’. How about it’s sometimes a dance and sometimes not a 
dance?</p>
<p><strong>What I mean here is a jig that you could dance a set to.</strong><br>
Right, I hear what you’re saying. So the idea of the piper playing his 
slow air and then going into something else – you see that’s not 
uniquely Irish. I think that’s what I was saying earlier on. You see 
that all over Europe for centuries. In Germany, as I say, you get <em>Tanz und Nachtanz</em>
 – you get the dance and the ‘after dance’. So you get this idea of 
something followed by something else that might be a bit livelier.</p>
<p>I know the tendency is to say that the jig arrives in Ireland in the 
seventeenth century, coming from Scotland. But what I would say is that 
that is a rhythm we’ve probably always had in Ireland, because that’s 
one of the oldest rhythms that you have in music.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325088013.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
In the medieval rhythmic modes, you’ve got about – I can’t remember 
offhand – about five or six modes. They’re all compound duple. They’re 
all …[sings]… so it can be …[sings]… something like that.</p>
<p>So they’re the oldest rhythms you have notated in music. It seems to 
me implausible that this idea came from somewhere else, or that it came 
from somewhere else as late as the seventeenth century. I don’t really 
find that plausible.</p>
<p>A lot of the sixteenth-century music that I’ve been looking at over 
the last few years has exactly this rhythm. If you look at, for example,
 <em>Cailín ó Cois tSiúire Mé</em> …[sings]… now that may well be a song, but that’s a jig.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325087075.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
Or you look at the two surviving instrumental dances – you have <em>Trenchmore</em> and <em>The Whip of Dunboyne</em>, which are attested to in the sixteenth century. <em>The Whip of Dunboyne</em> goes …[sings]… that’s a jig. And you have <em>Trenchmore</em> …[sings].</p>
<p>You see, this is one of the avenues I go down when I’m supposed to be
 finishing off CD liner notes or an essay! I keep thinking “oh yes, look
 – jigs in Ireland before everybody says there are jig!s”</p>
<p>[Sings]… and so on. Again it’s a kind of binary thing – it’s tonic / dominant.</p>
<p><strong>This is where I was going with my question. I think you may 
have confirmed what I was wondering. I was wondering is tonic / dominant
 and that approach to arranging the rhythm and mirroring that in your 
bass hand – is it entirely plausible because this is a jig potentially 
in that older style? In terms of time it comes from way back, before the
 jig is perceived as coming from Scotland in the seventeenth century. </strong><br>
Yes maybe – another name for embedded knowledge is ‘inarticulate’! You 
can’t figure out and articulate why you do things. But, yes, I suppose 
I’m playing all those jigs, these sixteenth-century jigs, and so I come 
to something like this and it just seems to me that it’s tonic / 
dominant. But you’re right, I have not actively associated in my brain 
before this conversation that <em>Cailín ó Cois tSiúire Mé</em>, <em>The Whip of Dunboyne</em>, <em>Trenchmore</em>, all of those ones – they’re all jigs .</p>
<p>But that’s what I’m saying to you – it doesn’t have to be either / 
or. It’s not a case of danced or not danced. Maybe it’s a case of 
sometimes at a speed that you would dance to and sometimes at a speed 
that you would sing to. Because <em>Cailín ó Cois tSiúire Mé</em> is obviously a song. It’s played on the harp, and it’s a song – it had words. <em>Trenchmore</em> and <em>The Whip of Dunboyne</em> are obviously jigs as well.</p>
<p>So I see this rhythm as a very old rhythm and I see this in Ireland 
pre-seventeenth century. And I see this playing a piece with a sort of 
‘Nachtanz’ as a completely standard European thing to do everywhere – 
it’s not special to Ireland. But maybe it lingers like everything else –
 it hangs out here long after it dies away elsewhere. So even in the 
eighteenth century you’ve got Carolan doing the same thing – Mrs. 
Birmingham and jig etc. Carolan has several jigs after his tunes.</p>
<p><strong>Did Carolan compose both the pieces and the associated jigs?</strong><br>
Oh yes, I think so. I don’t think we hear of him playing anybody else’s 
music – though maybe he did. But all those pieces, he’s composing them 
on the spot or for his patrons, so it’s got to be a new tune. You can’t 
insult somebody by offering them a new tune and giving them a tune that 
they might have heard somewhere else – it had better be a new tune. So 
no, I think he is composing the tunes and he’s used to this idea as 
well, so he’s composing this jig to go at the end of the tune.</p>
<p><strong>I have a real interest in physical movement as a way of 
interpreting rhythm. So I try to visualise how I would dance this jig 
after the Jointure. I understand how I could dance a set dance jig, that
 is familiar.</strong><br>
What speed would you dance a set-dance jig at? And is it a single or double jig – what kind of jigs are we talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Probably double jigs. I think they may have been danced in a very different way. It’s three time, right? </strong><br>
Well it’s duple – it’s …[sings]… one-and-two, one-and-two …[sings]…<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325083882.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe>remember
 jigs are not triple, they’re duple, but within each beat you have a 
triple beat, 1,2,3… 4,5,6 …[speaks]… 1… 2… so it depends on which level 
you’re looking at. Are you looking at 1… 2, 1… 2, or 1,2,3…4,5,6, 
1,2,3…4,5,6, or 1…2 …[speaks]. So it’s duple, it’s not triple. It’s 
triple on that level, but it’s duple on that level …[shows].</p>
<p>In the way that, for example, a minuet or something like that is 
triple. Let’s think of a Mozart minuet, or just any German beer drinking
 song, 1, 2, 3… 1, 2, 3 …[sings]… that’s a triple rhythm. But there’s a 
hierarchy between your two groups of three in a jig, because one is 
subservient to the other, I think …[sings].</p>
<p>Which is why I play …[music]… so I’m going 1… 2, 1…2, …[music]… so 
that defines for me the difference between 6/8 and 3/4. You could say 
“well they’re all going 1, 2, 3 … 1, 2, 3”, but I’d say no, the 3/4 is 
going 1, 2, 3 … 1, 2, 3, but the 6/8 is going 1… 2, 1…2, it’s an 
entirely different thing.</p>
<p>Except that Bunting sometimes notates things in 3/4 and you think 
maybe he meant 6/8. It depends on what speed somebody was playing at. If
 they were playing this slowly …[music]… then somebody might write it 
down as 1, 2, 3… 1, 2, 3. I might that down in 3/4. But if I wrote it 
down in 6/8 I think it’s implying that maybe it’s going a little bit 
faster and the stress hierarchy is different.</p>
<p>But I don’t know because I’m not a traditional musician. I didn’t 
have the great good fortune to grow up only hearing traditional music. 
Maybe a traditional player would listen to that and say that’s not how 
you should play that at all. And they’d have a completely different take
 on it. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>I don’t know either. I’m just curious. There could have been a
 dance, going back to the idea of embodied rhythm, that you could have 
danced in that way. Whereas I’m just trying to think “how would I even 
think about a jig?” I’d sing …[sings].</strong><br>
So I think you’re doing at least something parallel to what I’m doing. You’re going for<br>
the first beat of each six, and you’re backing off the fourth. You’re 
going …[sings]… like, sort of. I can beat my foot to it, if you know 
what I mean. I don’t know, I’m acutely conscious that I grew up in 
European music and not in traditional music.</p>
<p><strong>And I’m on the opposite side of the mirror and I’m just very curious to understand. </strong><br>
I think I’d sort of rather be on your side of the mirror</p>
<p><strong>I think it’s both though isn’t it? Because it’s written down –
 this music is notated. It’s to be able to interpret it from a notated 
form. </strong><br>
You see that’s the huge question. The problem is you’re going at it 
through layers. Because we’re looking at the deficiencies of writing 
anything down on a piece of paper. Because you can’t write music down. 
So as soon as you write it down you’ve removed a lot of the subtlety. 
And then who wrote it down? Well Bunting wrote it down, but he’s perhaps
 not somebody who grew up playing traditional Irish jigs. So he’s coming
 at it more with, say, my eye – the trained art-musician eye. So maybe 
there is stuff he’s missing. Maybe there is stuff I’m missing, because I
 just can’t see it. I don’t have the ear to hear it, or the education to
 pick it up. So we’re looking at what he writes down, and we’re looking 
at what somebody played long ago.</p>
<h1>LOOKING THROUGH BUNTING’S EYES</h1>
<p>So that’s one of the things I’m constantly thinking about, and – in a
 PhD context – something I have to address – that I’m going through 
various filters. I’m trying to reconstruct music but I’m looking at this
 music through Bunting’s eyes who is listening to the harper. So it’s 
quite a complex task, but I think it’s really interesting. To try and 
second-guess Bunting. To try and figure out what his mindset is, and why
 he might be notating what he is notating. And to try and get at the 
goods behind that through his filter.</p>
<p>And we can see many Bunting’s filters. Because I have a somewhat 
similar training to Bunting, i.e. European art music. I can see where 
he’s falling over himself trying to shoehorn things into a European 
mindset, and so I can get rid of those fairly effectively.</p>
<p><strong>You can identify those lenses and filters and adjust for them?</strong><br>
Yes, there are all sorts of filters and lenses to notice. Well not so 
much in his draft notebooks, but in his manuscript piano arrangements 
and in his published volumes, Bunting is trying to shoehorn things into 
major and minor keys. That is the very obvious thing that many editors 
are doing in the eighteenth century. The Neal collection does it – all 
these collections do it. For them the switch goes up or down – it’s 
major or it’s minor, and there’s nothing else. The idea of modal music 
completely escapes them, or if it doesn’t escape them they’re made 
deeply uneasy by it. Seen through their worldview, it’s just wrong and 
so it has to be fixed.</p>
<p><strong>Wrong, as in out of date?</strong><br>
No, it’s just wrong! It’s just like: it shouldn’t be, it’s an error, 
it’s an aberration, it’s just not right. You know, “the rustics don’t 
know what they’re doing. They’ve got it wrong”. And so editors ‘fix’ it.
 They start putting in sharp sevenths to fit with European music minor 
keys, or they start adding key signatures to make things ‘right’ 
according to their own system.</p>
<p>So you see that all over Bunting. Where if something, for example, is
 in Dorian or Aeolian – scales that go D to d and A to a with no sharps 
or flats. So D to d …[sings]… or the corresponding one in A …[sings]…<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325083458.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
So there’s only a difference of one note in those scales – the sixth note is a bit different.</p>
<p>Well they don’t compute that kind of natural minor scale at all. So 
they’re constantly shoehorning, trying to sharpen the sixth and seventh 
notes going up, and flatten them coming down, which is one of two 
possibilities in European music if you’re playing a minor scale.</p>
<p>So as soon as you recognize it, you can just jettison all of that. 
But there are probably more subtle things that Bunting is … well I don’t
 want to say ‘misinterpreting’ because I think we owe Bunting a huge 
debt of respect. The job he had to do at the age of nineteen would just 
turn your hair grey with the responsibility of it. He did a really good 
job. He was a very, very smart and literate musician.</p>
<p>But how about the idea that for any of us trying to write music down 
from somebody playing, it is really tough to do, even within the 
tradition. So if you’re a traditional musician – if you’re trying to 
write down somebody else’s tune, it’s hugely problematic, even if you’re
 very literate. I’m very literate but I have many problems notating from
 live performances. And supposing you’re not familiar at all with 
traditional music, how do you do it then? And then how about the fact 
that no traditional musician has ever played a tune the same way twice. 
So even if Bunting gets the harper to play the tune five times, he’s 
probably playing it five different ways! I know myself from trying to 
write tunes down from singers singing them. You ask “can you sing that 
verse again?”, and you think “well, that’s not what you did last time”, 
and you’ve failed to get it that time, and failed to get it this time, 
and they’re just changing the goal posts on you all the time!</p>
<p>So the job Bunting had was horrendous. And it was possibly an 
unfamiliar genre of music to him. The whole thing is a nightmare, so he 
did a brilliant job. But supposing he’s missing many subtleties. It’s 
like, for example, if you look at old collections of songs that were 
written down in the nineteenth- or twentieth century. Think of all the 
material that was written down in <em>an Rinn</em> in County Waterford. You have Margaret Hannigan and Séamus Clandillon for example writing down <em>Déise</em>
 songs in the 1920s. But if you listen to archived recordings of singers
 singing the same songs, of course they’re different. I mean, when 
people write down the tune – when Bunting is writing down these tunes – 
we have one version. But for sure the harper was playing different 
versions, in the same way that <em>sean-nós</em> singers won’t be 
singing the same thing on each verse. And if you listen to an archive 
recording, you can hear the beautiful subtleties where they change it on
 each verse, and that’s just part of the magic of what’s going on. Well 
that’s often lost to us, because we often only have one verse written 
down in a book, or one version of a tune written down by Bunting.</p>
<p>So already we’re losing, because there is all sort of stuff he didn’t
 write down, all sorts of stuff you couldn’t hear. It’s a disaster! We 
should just give up! We shouldn’t be doing this at all. We should just 
do something else entirely! [Laughing] But I like to keep failing better
 and better, if you know what I mean. I like to sort of try and figure 
it out, try and vaguely get close, knowing that it’s a hopeless task we 
set ourselves – utterly and completely hopeless. But great fun and 
hopefully of some value! [Smiling]</p>
<p>So we are talking about how Bunting notates what he’s hearing and how
 he feels constrained to notate it in a way that’s acceptable for his 
European art music rules. And so he gets himself into all sorts of 
horrible pickles because his rule system is different. So here’s an 
example of this kind of thing, this is <em>Bantiarna Ibheach / Lady Iveagh</em>, of Connellon. So the home note of the tune is G …[singing]… second half the tune starts on an F …[singing]… G, back home to G.<br>
<iframe src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210210214046if_/https://player.vimeo.com/video/325058195" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
So this is a very normal tune that you would typically hear. No problem.
 But poor old Bunting thinks “[G], okay”. He can hear that, so for him 
the the switch goes up or down – it’s G-major or it’s G-minor – they are
 the only two possibilities in his world. So if it’s G-major …[singing]…
 he has to have an [F-sharp]. But he knows the tune doesn’t have an 
[F-sharp], he knows that it has to be [F-naturals]. There is only one 
other way that switch can go. So if not G-major it has to be G-minor, so
 he dutifully puts in a key signature for G-minor – two flats, [B-flat] 
and [E-flat] …[singing]… fine, no problem.</p>
<p>But in the second half …[singing]… if we go with the key signature. 
But he knows it’s …[singing]… so he has to contradict his key signature,
 every time we get to an [E]. He knows that it’s not an [E-flat], he’s 
hearing an [E-natural]. And good musician that he is, he gives us the 
truth – he gives us the tune. So he thinks “no that’s an [E-natural]” 
…[singing]… he has to give us an [E-natural] there …[singing]… and so on
 so forth.</p>
<p>So Bunting is caught between a rock and a hard place. He has to give a
 key signature of G-minor, otherwise he’s carted off to musical-grammar 
jail! But he knows in his heart that it’s not an E-flat so he does both 
things – he satisfies both sides of himself. He gives the ‘correct’ 
thing – with a proper key signature – given that this piece starts and 
ends on [G]. And then he tells the truth by shoving in little accidental
 marks all over the place to make it tally.</p>
<p>So that’s a very easy lens to see, if you have European art-music 
training and if you understand about modal tunes. Students often ask me 
“why on earth does he put an [E-flat] in the key signature when every 
[E] is an [E-natural]?” Well, because he has to, to sort of feel okay.</p>
<p>So that’s the kind of thing you see frequently. And then the other 
kind of thing you see is when we are in Dorian and Aeolian modes, where 
it’s kind of a minor-ish sounding tonality. Then Bunting feels – and 
many others did in the eighteenth century, in lots of the collections – 
they would feel obliged to raise sixth and seventh notes of the melody 
going up, and lower them coming down, because that’s what you do in 
melodic minor scales. So very easy filters to see through once you know,
 once somebody points out, “oh that’s that filter, that’s that lens, 
that’s that one”. You go “oh yes, we can throw those away.”</p>
<p>But there’s probably other stuff that I’m not yet seeing – or which 
is impossible to see – because we haven’t heard the dead musician play 
that tune. If we heard them play and we saw the notation, we might say 
“oh look – Bunting missed this” or “Bunting didn’t get that”. Not that 
we blame him for it, but we would be able to compare. But now we’re in 
the unlucky position that his notations are all we have for a lot of the
 music so we have nothing left to compare it with.</p>
<h2><strong>SIOBHÁN’S MUSICAL JOURNEY</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Siobhán, could you tell the story of how you came to arrive 
at the early Irish harp? I know singing has played a huge part along 
your journey and so it would be wonderful to learn what insights and 
turning points you experienced along the way, both with with your 
harp-playing and with your singing. </strong><br>
I started playing the piano – my first instrument – around 1970. I was 
tiny. I got sent off to piano lessons with my sister who was six years 
older. I must have shown some aptitude because by 1973 or 1974 my piano 
teacher was suggesting to my parents that I should learn an additional 
instrument – that I had gone as far as I could in three years – my hands
 were small and I couldn’t do any more grade exams – and that it was 
time to add another instrument.</p>
<p>I like to fancy that I actually remember this conversation – my 
teacher saying to my mother that I could learn the violin and my mother 
agreeing, and I was in the background saying “no, no, I don’t want to 
learn the violin!” and my reason was that I couldn’t sing with it. I 
think that’s kind of interesting, given that my whole life has revolved 
around vocal music and accompanying singers, in all kinds of music from 
plainchant to Irish music, and from seventeenth-century chamber music to
 baroque opera. So I knew that you can’t sing with the violin. My piano 
teacher took me seriously and asked me what instrument I wanted to play 
instead. I said ‘the harp’.</p>
<p>I have no idea why I said the harp. I have experienced the same thing
 with lots of children I’ve taught over the years. At the first lesson I
 always ask “so, why do you want to learn this instrument?” and almost 
without exception they all say “I don’t know, I just want to play the 
harp”. They can’t articulate why. And I think it was even more bizarre 
in my case because in the early 1970s I don’t think there was very much 
harping going on. I think Mary O’Hara might have been playing. That was 
about it. So I don’t know where I got this idea that I wanted to play 
the harp.</p>
<p>But my parents took me seriously and bought me a harp made by George 
Imbusch in Limerick. I was bought an Imbusch harp and I started lessons 
with Nancy Calthorpe at the then College of Music, which is now DIT in 
Chatham Row in Dublin. I think around 1973-74.</p>
<p>I also went to a really good school for music ­– St. Louis’s in 
Rathmines, Dublin. I was moved to their National School in something 
like second or third class and before that I’d been in a <em>Gaelscoil</em> [Irish language school] – <em>Scoil Mhuire</em>
 in Marlborough Street, on the grounds of the Department of Education, 
just opposite the Pro-Cathedral. So I’d done all my education through my
 Irish until that point, and thereafter went to St. Louis.</p>
<p>They had quite a famous choir ­– The Young Dublin Singers – and so 
that was the first choir I started singing in. I was in all sorts of 
different choirs after that.</p>
<p>Sometime around 1980 I started having singing lessons with Ken 
Shellard in Dublin, who had a real early music bent, and so was very 
receptive to somebody who wanted to sing Dowland and Purcell and 
sixteenth- and seventeenth-century European music. That was the music he
 loved as well.</p>
<p>So I was on this dual path of singing and harping. I was unmotivated 
at practicing the piano – it wasn’t really my thing. I was genuinely 
interested in the harp and I was really interested in singing. I’d have 
to admit that singing was perhaps my greater love.</p>
<p>I went on to study Single-Honour Music at Trinity College Dublin. I 
think my years at Trinity were from autumn of 1982, graduating in 1986. 
At that stage I started having harp lessons with Mercedes Garvey – the 
pedal-harp teacher at the College of Music – for about two years. She 
was a wonderful, very gracious person, so I think I probably had a nice 
time with her, but I wasn’t really keen to get a pedal harp. So it was 
modern harping all the way, but very much early music singing. At 
college I was singing, well, everything up to the <em>Kindertotenlieder</em>
 of Mahler – I loved some romantic music as well. But mainly my interest
 was in early music. I was exposed, of course, to wonderful things once I
 started doing a music degree.</p>
<p>There was an excellent chamber choir at Trinity College Dublin called
 Trinity College Singers. For the first two years of college I was a 
member and I was exposed for the first time to madrigals – English 
madrigals from the sixteenth-century. And polyphonic Renaissance masses.
 And Brahms double choir motets. And Bach! Bach motets. All sorts of 
things. In my third year I became the director of the choir and then we 
did everything from Byrd masses to Kodaly. So I really enjoyed directing
 all this choral music, and in turn introducing younger undergraduates 
to music that they had never heard before. That was a really wonderful 
time.</p>
<p>So I had some success, let’s say, at harp competitions. I went to the
 harp festival in Granard – I think it was around 1982 – and there were 
two things that I remember from that festival. One was that the Reverend
 Christopher Warren was there, with his take on the Trinity College harp
 that he had built himself. I remember he had it up on a car bonnet 
somewhere outside and he was showing it to people.</p>
<p>I also remember going into a pub at lunchtime with my parents looking
 for lunch, and I remember Ann Heymann, and her husband, Charlie 
Heymann, were sitting in the corner. They were playing music. That was 
the first time I’d ever heard anyone playing an early Irish harp.</p>
<p>I think that was probably a pivotal moment. I was too young – and too
 shy – to say hello to Ann, but I squirreled that information away – “oh
 there’s a harp that sounds amazing”. I understood straight away that it
 was very different to the kind of harp that I played. So already I 
understood that there are two different kinds of Irish harp.</p>
<p>In my final year at college, around 1986, the <em>Early Music Organization of Ireland</em>
 (EMOI) put on one of its annual festivals in Dublin. The historical 
harpist, Andrew Lawrence-King, came to play at it, actually in Trinity 
College. He was playing a double-strung Italian baroque harp – known as 
an <em>arpa doppia</em>, with two parallel rows of strings, and a 
Spanish baroque harp – also a chromatic instrument where you have two 
rows of strings crossed over in an X-shape so that you can get at the 
diatonic and chromatic notes. And then a penny really dropped.</p>
<p>He was playing the music that I loved and that I was trying to play 
on my modern Irish harp. I remember giving an exam recital in third 
year, and I remember trying to play a variation set by Bernardo Pasquini
 on the <em>follia</em> ground bass. I also remember playing Handel 
keyboard music at that recital. I was always trying to play seventeenth-
 and eighteenth-century music, and my hands would be a blur with the 
levers trying to do all the chromatic changes. So when I saw Andrew’s 
harps, I thought “wow! That’s the music I love and these are the harps 
you play them on”. So again, I probably squirreled that information 
away, but wasn’t in a position to do anything else about it.</p>
<p>In 1986 or ‘87 – sorry to be so hazy on dates – I graduated and I 
moved to Stuttgart in Germany. I took up a job at a music school – to 
start a harp department in a <em>Musikschule</em> in Sindelfingen 
outside Stuttgart, and started giving solo harp and voice recitals 
mainly in the German-speaking world. Maybe around 1991, Andrew 
Lawrence-King was playing at the early music festival in Stuttgart.</p>
<p>So he was starting to be really interested in early Irish harp at 
that stage and I was desperate to talk to somebody playing early harps, 
so this was just a wonderful happenstance that the two of us got talking
 at that concert.</p>
<p>So the upshot of that was that he became my historical harps teacher,
 and over the course of a year I drove up to Bremen, which is about 500 
miles further north, to have lessons with him at the then <em>Akademie für Alte Musik</em>.
 I bought a small Italian baroque harp built by Tim Hobrough and started
 taking harp lessons. I could already play harp so it was just a matter 
of getting used to a multi-row harp which is actually no mean feat. For 
the first day or week or month you just want to give up because it’s so 
complicated and you feel seasick when you look at the strings and you 
can’t recognize anything and it’s a nightmare! But I loved the music so 
much and I really wanted to play. So Andrew started teaching me about 
early fingering, early aesthetics and phrasing and other relevant issues
 I didn’t know much about before. That was a revelation.</p>
<p>After six lessons, Andrew kindly started passing on work to me. The 
very first job was in 1992 when I went to a Monteverdi festival in Japan
 to play the <em>continuo</em> [improvising over a given bass line] and the harp solo in Monteverdi’s opera <em>L’Orfeo</em> which is one of the first ever operas.</p>
<p>So that started off my world of playing baroque chamber music and 
opera. After that I started buying myself instruments – a bigger double 
harp, a triple harp, a Spanish baroque harp, a European single-row 
late-medieval harp.</p>
<p>While I was playing all those harps I carried on playing my modern Irish harp – a <em>Camac</em> harp from France.</p>
<p>And at one point – around 1995 – I was in Amsterdam, doing a baroque 
opera, and in my spare time I was trying to make an arrangement of 
Carolan’s <em>Eleanor Plunkett</em> or <em>Brigid Cruise</em> on my 
modern Irish harp. And suddenly the light bulb went on, and I thought 
“but this isn’t the harp Carolan played. His harp didn’t have levers and
 it didn’t have gut strings, and I’m not getting close to what he did at
 all”.</p>
<p>The other thing that struck me around the same time was that my <em>Camac</em>
 harp was sitting in my apartment in Germany surrounded by all the other
 harps. They were all from a similar stable, all these historical 
instruments. The one in the middle – the modern one made of composite 
woods with white and blue and red plastic semitone levers – it just 
jarred utterly with the others. It looked modern and they looked old and
 it was just dissonant.</p>
<p>So eventually the penny dropped and I thought “but we’ve got our own 
early harp in Ireland!”. I’m quite a slow person, you know! It takes 
quite a while for the the penny to drop with me! I thought “I’m playing 
the Spanish early harp and the Italian one and the European medieval 
one, but what about my own early harp?”, and once that penny dropped my 
whole life changed. That was it. I basically haven’t stopped running 
since.</p>
<h2>HISTORICALLY INFORMED PERFORMANCE &amp; THE EARLY IRISH HARP</h2>
<p>I had done quite a bit of traveling around that time. I moved to 
Australia very briefly in 1994, but I came back the same year and I 
moved to London. In London I was playing Baroque chamber music and 
opera, and I started to work with the main groups like John Eliot 
Gardiner and his English Baroque Soloists, and Paul McCreesh and the 
Gabrieli Consort, in London. And also with William Christie and Les Arts
 Florissants in Paris. And also I became the harpist with Tragicomedia 
after Andrew Lawrence-King left the trio that he had founded with the 
lute player Steven Stubbs and the viol player Erin Headley. My earliest 
historical music recordings are with those groups. That’s where I 
learned oodles about everything to do with what is called HIP – 
Historically Informed Performance. The idea of HIP is that you’re trying
 to get your hands on appropriate instruments, you’re trying to find the
 best sources that you can use for the music, that you want to get into 
the mindset of the people who composed and played these early 
compositions, that you’re interested in the aesthetics and the phrasing,
 all of that. All this I learned from my colleagues – from Steve and 
from Erin. And also from my then partner, the tenor John Elwes, who 
later became my husband. He was just such an extraordinary musician. So 
now I had somebody at home that I could run music past and say “well how
 about this? How about that?” He was absolutely fundamental to my 
learning a whole new aesthetic and how to perform.</p>
<p>So I think it was around 1995 that another penny dropped – that I 
needed to get my hands on an early Irish harp. Bill Taylor and Ardival 
harps in Scotland were hugely helpful in that regard. Bill kindly lent 
me an old harp that was lying around the workshop until they could build
 me one&nbsp;– an Ardival ‘Rose’. I remember traveling around Europe and
 not wanting to be without my early Irish harp, so I dragged it along in
 addition to my enormous Italian harp. And I remember practicing 
incessantly in tea- and lunch breaks while rehearsing baroque opera 
productions.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was to work my way through Ann Heymann’s <em>Secrets of the Gaelic Harp</em>
 book, so that was my first teacher. I made contact with Ann for the 
first time and went to visit her that year and the year after, to study 
with her.</p>
<p><strong>How did you first come across Ann’s book?</strong><br>
That’s a very good question. I wonder if it was Bill Taylor who told me 
about it. Where would I have come across it? Because I bought a copy of 
the book. I can see myself in France working through, in breaks in an 
opera. Every time there was a break I would run into the other room to 
practice this thing. I was manic about it!</p>
<p><strong>What was your feeling when you first came across it?</strong><br>
It opened a really important door for me. Without Ann’s pioneering work 
it would have been much more difficult for me. She and her work have 
been hugely inspirational for me. Her book gave me tools to play the new
 instrument. And that was like the night turning into day, it was like 
the light coming on. It was just incredible. Not to be too dramatic 
about it, but it was like my whole life had been preparation for this 
because I was an Irish musician, I had an ear for Irish music, but I’d 
had all this art music training, so I was literate and I was going to be
 able to look at these manuscripts. Then I also had all this early music
 training, and I was already playing other historical harps with 
historical techniques.</p>
<p>I had even grown my nails already to play my big Italian baroque 
harp, because Steve Stubbs played his theorbo [large Baroque lute] and 
baroque guitar with his nails. When we were in big opera theatres he 
could make a big noise and I wanted to be able to match him with my 
harp. So I’d already grown my nails and then when I got a Spanish harp 
it was appropriate to play that with nails too. So, with nails already, 
it was like just a hop, skip and a jump – I just had to be shown this 
other thing and off I went.</p>
<p>So it’s funny looking back on it – I’ve never thought about that 
until you posed that question. But yes, I suppose it was like the sun 
came out.</p>
<p><strong>I can imagine you were yearning…</strong><br>
Yes, suddenly like “oh yes, that’s the thing!”. How did it take me until my late twenties?</p>
<p><strong>So you had this introduction to the Irish harp and you were 
about to explain how you got in touch with Ann first. Did you remember 
her from that first time you saw her in Granard?</strong><br>
I think I was talking incessantly about Ann because I was working 
through the book. We all knew about Ann and I think she was in our 
consciousness in Ireland even though she hadn’t really been invited over
 much. Our paths hadn’t yet crossed.</p>
<p>I first met her when I decided to go to Minnesota to see her.</p>
<p>And of course that was revelatory, because she was so generous with 
her time, her knowledge and her expertise, and, you know, everything. I 
suppose for her maybe it was unusual to have a harpist from Ireland 
knocking on her door. Ann wasn’t Irish, and didn’t live in Ireland. So 
maybe she didn’t always quite get the respect that she should have got 
for her pioneering work. So it was probably surprising for her that an 
Irish woman literally knocked on her door saying “please tell me about 
the harp and the music of my country”. And I was thrilled to meet her.</p>
<p><strong>How long did you stay with her?</strong><br>
I think the first time it might have been three days. That was enough – I
 was a wreck at the end of it, because she just talked at me round the 
clock! She’d say “here’s another thing and here’s another thing”. I’d 
say “OK I have to go to bed now!” She’d literally be knocking on my door
 in the morning saying “well here’s this other stuff I haven’t said 
anything about”. So at the end of three days I was just like a wet rag, 
you know, but full of ideas! I went back again about a year later and we
 talked lots more.</p>
<h2>MOVING BACK TO IRELAND, ESTABLISHING THE HISTORICAL HARP SOCIETY OF IRELAND</h2>
<p>In 1998 I moved back to Ireland. I’d moved to London in the 1990s 
from Germany. My husband, John Elwes, and I moved to an old cottage 
outside Carrick-on-Suir in the foothills of the Comeragh mountains. We 
moved there because John’s paternal family, are from there.</p>
<p>When you asked me for my memories for this interview, I started going
 through papers. When I moved back to Ireland or maybe even before I 
moved back, it looks as if I took over the directorship of the <em>Early Music Organization of Ireland </em>.
 I directed that organization for several years, putting on everything 
from concerts to choral workshops with English choral directors, trying 
to get expertise to Ireland.</p>
<p>I can’t tell if it was when I was directing the <em>Early Music Organization of Ireland</em>
 or if it was beforehand, I wrote an article for the EMOI newsletter. I 
haven’t found the actual newsletter but I found the text that I sent off
 and it looks as if I was addressing questions about the fact that there
 was an early music scene all around the world for different instruments
 – for lutes and viols and keyboard instruments – and raising the idea 
that we had our own early harp and were we going to take our place in 
this revival of instruments. Were we going to do anything with the early
 Irish harp? I mentioned in that article that Gráinne Yeats and Paul 
Dooley were the only players I knew in Ireland who are actually 
approaching the instrument on its own terms at that stage. And then I 
asked anybody who was interested in playing the instrument to contact 
me. So I think I was interested already in the late 1990s to make 
connections with other people to see if we could get something going.</p>
<p>Then in January 1998 I sent Ann Heymann a fax, telling her that I had two <em>cláirseach</em>
 students, as I called them. So the nomenclature I have used really 
changed a lot over the years. At that stage I was calling it a <em>cláirseach</em>. I think this was probably because Ann was calling it a <em>cláirseach</em>. One student, in Galway, was undoubtedly Maura Uí Chróinín, who runs <em>Galway Early Music Festival</em>,
 and who is now involved in The Historical Harp Society of Ireland. The 
student in Dublin, I think, might have been somebody called Mary Gregg.</p>
<p>Ann was very keen for an early Irish harp revival to happen in 
Ireland, and she strongly encouraged me to start organising. A few years
 after that –&nbsp;perhaps around the year 2002 – Bill Taylor and 
Barnaby Brown organised a conference and invited a number of early Irish
 harp players to Glasgow. Bill was instrumental in organising this – 
what he called a ‘fingernail technique’ – conference in Glasgow. It took
 place at the home of the parents of Barnaby Brown, the historical 
Scottish piper. So Bill had this great idea to get us all together in 
one place. Ann Heymann was there, Simon Chadwick was there, Bill Taylor 
was there, Barnaby Brown was there, and Javier Sáinz from Spain was 
there, Karen Marshalsay, the Scottish player was there. Alison Kinnaird 
was invited but I think couldn’t make it? So this was the first time 
that I’d met many of them. There were really important and vital 
contacts made at that stage. One of the most important was with Simon 
Chadwick who is now very closely involved with the HHSI and has been for
 a long time.</p>
<p>So in about 2003 – with Ann Heymann still very kindly encouraging and supporting me – I put on the first <em>Scoil na gCláirseach</em>.
 Simon Chadwick put the website together for it and also came over as a 
student. I offered to cover Ann’s airfare out of my own pocket if she 
came over, and the two of us would teach the classes. She was so 
generous – she said “oh yes, I don’t mind if you don’t pay me. If the 
airfare is covered, that’s great”. That was the first year.</p>
<p>Philip Edmondson at the School of Music in Kilkenny very kindly 
offered us a venue for free. Unbelievably – I can’t believe I did this 
for the first few years – I made all the soup and baked all the bread 
and put it all in the freezer and then would take it out, day by day, 
and serve all the lunches. So I taught the courses, administered it, and
 did all the cooking. Amazingly I think about twelve people showed up 
the first year and also the second year. That was kind of amazing to me.</p>
<p><strong>I think I attended for the first time in its third year, in 2005</strong><br>
That’s right. And how did you find out about it?</p>
<p><strong>A leaflet at the Irish Traditional Music Archive. I think I had dropped in one afternoon when the <em>Scoil</em> was already underway. I got on a bus to Kilkenny the next day</strong><br>
So that first year, Michael Coady, the poet from Carrick-on-Suir, opened
 it for us on the 18th of August. Gráinne Yeats gave our first lecture –
 she spoke about the harpers assembly in Belfast in 1792. Apparently the
 second day was the day that we went to Dublin to look at the harps in 
museums, because that’s now always our last day or optional day. So the 
second day, for some reason, we went to Dublin to see all the museum 
harps, and then we came back and had tuition afterwards from 6pm to 
8:15pm at night. So it’s clear that I was a bit of a slave-driver from 
the word go! I can’t believe that I would make people go on a day trip 
to Dublin and then have hours of tuition afterwards. But I did!</p>
<p>So Ann and I did the teaching. Seán Donnelly gave a lecture about the
 early Irish harp in seventeenth-century England. And Ann and I gave a 
public concert that week as well. I think the course was about four days
 long.</p>
<p><strong>I played fiddle growing up, and from around the age of eleven or twelve I remember going to the <em>Willy Clancy Summer School</em>
 in Miltown Malbay. I remember it all going over my head the first year,
 but in the second year something just clicked and I was able to play 
tunes with other musicians my own age. That was the environment – going 
one year and then the following year going along wanting to be able to 
join in with others, and then year after year, and I still go down – not
 every year but every few years – and it is like a music school, a 
summer school. I’m curious about the ideas for <em>Scoil na gCláirseach</em>
 in 2003. What was your thinking at the time – you, Ann, Simon, what 
were you thinking of creating? Or was it very much “we’ll try it one 
year and we’ll see where it takes us”?</strong><br>
Well, I remember it was myself and Ann for the first two years. Simon 
did the website but otherwise he was a student, not yet a staff member. 
So he wasn’t involved in the planning. He might have been involved from 
maybe the third year? So say for the first two years I just wanted there
 to be some event in Ireland, because already I was teaching early Irish
 harp courses abroad and people would say “that’s great, can we go to 
Ireland and study with you there?” And I had to say “no, I don’t really 
have a course in Ireland”. There was no focal point in Ireland then.</p>
<p>I think Ann was seminal. She was the one who kept on saying to me 
“there needs to be something in Ireland…there has to be something in 
Ireland… in Ireland”. So I suppose I just thought I’d get everybody 
together. I suppose I love teaching – that’s my thing – it is all about 
education and teaching. So that would have been my idea – to get people 
together to disseminate ideas and information. I don’t remember but I 
imagine that was the idea – to get the world expert over, and the two of
 us would rub shoulders, and spend time with other people who played the
 instrument. And then see what we could start – see where that would 
take us. It was very organic.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how much I was really thinking through things because <em>The Historical Harp Society of Ireland</em> didn’t exist until <em>after</em>
 the summer school started. I wasn’t thinking of founding a Society. I 
was thinking of doing a very specific thing, which was to have this 
event. The event predated the Society. The Society came out of the 
event. I suppose we realized the need once people came to the summer 
school – that then they wanted to have lessons on a more regular basis. 
And then they needed instruments and there were no instruments. So one 
organic thing led to another.</p>
<p>We started wondering what we would do for harps. There were no 
readily affordable student copies of early Irish harps on the market. We
 had a pretty rigorous view of things from the start – that we wanted 
people playing copies of the instruments that were in the museums, 
rather than modern designs or the miniature harps that were available. 
We wanted them playing a harp with a minimum of twenty-nine strings, 
implying an historical full bass range.</p>
<p><strong>Did this come from your background, your immersion, in early music?</strong><br>
Yes, I think you’re right. That’s exactly where that would come from 
because I had that kind of uncompromising, rigorous approach. Trying to 
play Italian baroque on my modern Irish harp had led me to seek out the 
appropriate instrument – a multi-row chromatic Italian harp. So, for me,
 the music leads you to the appropriate instrument. So for early Irish 
music, I want to play it on the original Irish harp.</p>
<p>At some point – around 2001 – I had this Trinity College harp sort of
 sneak into my life through Robert Maclean who was a student of mine– 
and also of Ann Heymann – living in Japan. He and Ann had commissioned 
two Trinity College copies together – twin harps. Robert is Canadian but
 of Scottish extraction so ultimately he wasn’t really happy to have an 
Irish harp – he really wanted a copy of the Scottish Queen Mary harp. He
 came to Europe to have lessons with me for a few months, at one point, 
and he brought the harp. He wanted to leave it with me with a view to 
selling it in Europe.</p>
<p>I remember taking it out of its bag and playing just a few strings 
and being completely taken aback. I’d never heard anything like this, 
because I hadn’t heard any kind of replica before. I’d had a much 
smaller Ardival ‘Rose’, which sounded lovely to me – a beautifully built
 instrument but smaller than the smallest surviving harps. So when I 
took this out and played – and of course it had a lot of Ann in it 
because she had a lot to do with the design of the instruments and David
 Kortier, who had built it, was a really good builder – I was completely
 smitten.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk a little bit about the harp-maker?</strong><br>
David Kortier was, at that stage, I suppose the best-known builder of 
early Irish harps. And he lived close to Ann in Minnesota. So she had a 
good working relationship with him over the years. Robert Maclean was 
Ann’s student – that was probably why he and she ordered harps together.
 Between Kortier and Ann’s input into this harp, it was just gorgeous. 
So I remember saying to Robert “okay, don’t spend too much money on 
advertising this harp anywhere”, because it clearly wasn’t ever going to
 leave my music room! So I always joke that the harp came to me, all the
 way from Japan, presented itself to me in my music room, went “here I 
am”, and I went “thank you very much, that’s lovely, you’re grand.” So I
 didn’t have to go out looking for harp. It literally arrived in my lap.
 It was quite an extraordinary thing.</p>
<p>So once we started to think we needed student instruments for <em>The Historical Harp Society</em>,
 Kortier was the man to get in contact with. So now we have copied about
 six or so of the eighteen extant harps, but that was never our plan. 
Our plan was just to have <em>one</em> harp that we could offer to 
students. I remember Kortier came over for a meeting. I think Simon and I
 and Kortier were all at my house and we were thrashing out ideas. And 
we said “well, how about the Trinity College harp, that would be a good 
student instrument. So can you maybe build copies of that?”<br>
<iframe src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210210214046if_/https://player.vimeo.com/video/325056123" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
So he started off doing that and then off his own bat he said “oh I was 
doing that and I thought I’d do a Queen Mary as well”. So he did a Queen
 Mary as well and we thought “oh, that’s two of the surviving harps!” 
And then the idea got going “hey, we could keep going with this. We 
could build relatively inexpensive student copies of all of these 
harps.” That’s been our plan over the last decade and a half, to keep 
going, to build measured copies of these things so we can all get our 
hands on them and play and learn from them. And of course what I’ve been
 playing for you today, is one of our latest models which is the <em>HHSI Student Mullaghmast</em> harp.</p>
<p>So …[shows]… they’re inexpensively built out of composite wood. They 
have built-up sound boxes so that they’re much cheaper to build than a 
carved-out soundbox. They have Kortier’s measurements, so they are based
 on his measuring work at the individual museums. Things are moving on 
with measurements all the time, and modern technology is raising the 
bar. In 2016, I initiated an exciting project to do laser-scan 
measurements of early Irish harps. In December 2016 I commissioned the 
first ever 3D laser scan of an early Irish harp – the <em>Mullaghmast</em> harp, because I want to have a facsimile of this built.</p>
<p>So anyway, they are our <em>HHSI Student</em> range. That was a new 
thing. That had never happened in the revival before, that people 
started to make affordable copies of the surviving harps. A few people 
have had facsimiles but they’re very expensive, and we were trying to 
mass-produce them and get them into students’ hands.</p>
<p>So we’ve carried on with the summer school and with the student 
harps. And then all sorts of things happened along the way. Like our 
fledgling library – we started the first ever library for everything to 
do with the the early Irish harp and associated culture, history, 
poetry, vocal music and related subjects.</p>
<p>And here we are now in 2017 and we’re planning for our sixteenth 
summer school next year in 2018 – or a summer festival as it’s become – 
because it slightly changed from last year. We have started to put on 
many more concerts – a concert each evening instead of one over the 
course of the whole week. We’ll hopefully get more of the public in next
 year to our lectures and workshops. So we’re expanding out – that’s 
where we are right now.</p>
<h2><strong>HARP-MAKING: ANCIENT &amp; MODERN TECHNOLOGY MEETING</strong></h2>
<p><strong>I’m curious to delve a little into harp-making some more. It 
is one thing to make student harps affordably, but another to so with 
very rigorous standards. Is there a way of making affordable student 
harps with rigorous attention to key historical features, other than 
going to a renowned harp-maker and trusting that he will make sensible 
decisions?</strong><br>
It’s all a compromise. There’s no such thing as the perfect facsimile. Kortier made our first range, which we call <em>HHSI Student</em> harps. But we’re really keen to support Irish harp builders as well. So our second range, our <em>HHSI Connemara</em> harps, are built for us in Connemara by Natalie Surina of <em>Ériu Harps</em>.</p>
<p>I see a huge place for technology going forward. Because until this 
point we’ve basically been in museums with measuring tapes. That’s the 
way it’s always worked. Until now. I want to have a copy built of the <em>Mullaghmast</em>
 harp myself, and so in December 2016 the National Museum of Ireland 
agreed to let me bring in a company that specialized in laser scanning <em>3D Scanning Ireland</em>.
 All of that data is now captured, which is great because it means that 
we should be able to use point-to-point meshes on our computers and 
measure from point to point on it. So that’s going to give a whole new 
level of accuracy to building.</p>
<p>And then you have the possibility that you can take data from those 
meshes and you can feed it into a CAM woodworking machine. You could 
theoretically go from a scan to an automated pillar or neck or whatever 
to make student instruments. That’s not beyond the bounds of reason 
anymore. And that would be very cheap. So I think the future is quite 
exciting for getting our hands on excellently measured, inexpensive 
student instruments.</p>
<p>Since I did that in 2016, it seems to be taking on a life of its own,
 because one of our students at the summer festival wants to have the 
Fitzgerald Kildare harp scanned in order to build a copy of that. And I 
think another player has been interested in scanning Paddy Quin’s 
instrument, the Otway harp. So now it looks like people are running with
 that ball which is great. I’m very happy about that.</p>
<p><strong>What’s involved in 3D scanning?</strong><br>
Well, one of the reasons I shied away from it was that I thought it was 
complicated and difficult. I think about ten years ago there were mobile
 scanners but they couldn’t deal with metal, so I thought it was 
impossible. But even in ten years technology had moved on. I phoned them
 up and they said “oh that’s no trouble – we can just come out to the 
museum”. I said “but don’t you have a huge rig, or does the harp have to
 go into a scanning machine?” They said “oh no, no we just have a little
 mobile machine that we wave at it”. So it turns out that the mobile 
scanning machine looks like the body of an electric mixer. It is 
completely non-invasive and it’s just completely wonderful, though still
 relatively expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe you could talk about Karen Loomis’s work? Where she has
 put harps through a CT scanner, which is limited by the dimensions of 
the machine.</strong> Dr. Karen Loomis is an astronomer from the USA who came to the <em>Scoil</em>
 one year and then took a scientific interest in the surviving historic 
harps. She recently finished an incredibly valuable PhD on the 
organology of the <em>Queen Mary</em> and <em>Lamont</em> harps. Karen 
made CT scans of the harps as part of her research work, which has 
allowed us to see the inside these instruments for the very first time, 
which is amazing.</p>
<p>The type of scanning that I’ve been doing is showing us the outside 
of the instrument, but that’s valuable too because it gives us more data
 than ever before to build instruments from. So yes – wonderful, 
wonderful possibilities afoot these days on the technology side of 
things.</p>
<p><strong>I’d like to delve into the technological side of things some 
more. Considering we’re looking for the early Irish music which is 
modal. In other words the music typically doesn’t change key during a 
piece, and it has seven notes or fewer to the scale. There are 
exceptions and subtleties, but that is a basic working definition. To 
play modal music you want to have an instrument which is matched. This 
is my own reading of the early Irish harp, the Trinity, and the other 
seventeen extant museum instruments that we have. For the music they are
 associated with, I’d suggest they really were a pinnacle of technology 
for their time. Would you agree? </strong></p>
<p>Well let’s think about that for a bit. Certainly, bits of them were. 
We have metal strings because we had amazing metal working technology in
 Ireland. Wire harp strings are actually quite unsophisticated compared 
to all the Bronze Age treasures you’d see in the Kildare Street branch 
of The National Museum. There’s serious technological expertise on view 
there ­ unbelievably fine work . Compared to that, harp strings are just
 a doddle! Because you’re just drawing a piece of wire. You’re not 
trying to do anything fancy with it afterwards. And the mortise and 
tenon joints – that’s quite simple technology actually. And the 
‘dugout-canoe’ aspect of the resonating chamber is theoretically easy to
 do. I wouldn’t want to have to do it myself, mind – it’s a lot of work,
 but it’s not complicated in itself. But the amazing thing to be seen on
 these harps is the decoration. They’re high-art objects with beautiful 
jewels, fine metal work and wood carving. That’s very impressive.</p>
<p><strong>That’s interesting. It brings to mind something I read years 
ago about good design – I forget where. I think the example was the 
safety pin. That good design is so smart that it is self-evident, as in 
“why didn’t we think of that before?”. What Antoine de Saint-Exupéry 
writes about the airplane wing also come to mind – that “perfection is 
achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is 
nothing left to take away.”</strong><br>
Oh lovely. I like that. Well that speaks to me totally, because it 
reminds me of how I reconstruct my own tunes. Over the years I have been
 jettisoning harmony and this and that, and I’m really left with very 
little at this stage. It’s almost embarrassingly little!</p>
<p><strong>So I’m wondering if it was something similar with the design 
of the early Irish harp. I wonder whether there were many versions to 
begin with, which became progressively simpler and simpler. And I’m 
wondering, for the type of early Irish, modal music we’re talking about,
 whether the view that early Irish harps don’t have levers, don’t have 
pedals, no chromatic notes, is relevant at all?</strong><br>
Well you would only say that if you’re looking back from a modern 
perspective. You wouldn’t be taking the instrument on its own merits 
within its own time.</p>
<p><strong>Which is why I’m talking about taking it in the context of 
the associated early Irish music – modal music with seven or less notes 
to the scale and so on.</strong><br>
Yes, it’s perfect for the music I play on it. But that’s the whole point
 of an historically informed performance (HIP) approach – that the 
instruments used are appropriate for the music played on them. You 
mentioned early Irish harps and levers there. I always joke and say that
 to give an early Irish harp levers is to give a fish a bicycle. It’s 
completely irrelevant – it’s from a different universe.</p>
<p>So an early instrument generally reflects the music of the period. 
For example, the Italian triple harp. Why did that come about? Well, 
single-row harps existed everywhere. We had them in Ireland, you find 
them all around Europe. But chromatic harps originated only in the last 
decades of the sixteenth century, initially to play the newly chromatic 
music which was emerging at that time.</p>
<p>If you want to play modal Irish music, one wonderful way to do it is 
to play it on the Irish harp that was played for over eight hundred 
years. Possibly a thousand, who knows? Gerald of Wales was talking about
 that harp in the late 1100s, and the kind of mature design to be seen 
in the earliest depiction on <em>Breac Maedóic</em> [Shrine of St. 
Mogue] didn’t fall off the back of a bus in that century – there is an 
implication that it goes back much earlier than that.</p>
<p><strong>That length of history, of time, 800 years at least. A technological design gets refined during that time.</strong><br>
Well interestingly though, it didn’t get refined much during that time. 
It must have been in the time before that, that it got refined, because 
it’s such a good design that it basically remained consistent from, well
 we don’t know how far back in time. We have no idea how old the Trinity
 College harp is for instance. But if you look at depictions, if you 
look at <em>Breac Maedóic</em> it’s showing a triangular harp, presumably with mortise and tenon joints, and you can basically make out the <em>leithrind</em>
 – the metal cheek bands on the neck, through which the string pins go. 
So it looks like that design is already fixed, in perhaps the eleventh 
century, and those features carry on all the way to the end of the 
tradition c.1800. I don’t see many differences, except that the harp 
gets bigger – the neck goes up, and the bass strings get longer. But the
 design is so excellent it retains consistency for over 800 years.</p>
<p><strong>In engineering, a design is often discussed in terms of 
whether or not it is ‘fit for purpose’. The term for fixing the design 
at a point in time is ‘design freeze’. There is typically a phase when 
the design is fluid, when all the parameters are set, stresses and 
strains are estimated, and the functional requirements of the design are
 defined and agreed. All of this is typically done up front, leading to 
design freeze. Then the design is built, and throughout the design life 
of that technology, it needs to be fit for purpose. Working as an 
engineer, it’s natural for me to apply these design principles when 
considering historic Irish technology, and in the case of early Irish 
harps being fit for purpose, to ask for what purpose are they fit? And 
it seems to me it is to play the music that was recorded in the Bunting 
manuscripts.</strong></p>
<p>Well, except that there isn’t so much difference between our harp and
 the European harps – it’s not the number of rows, because we all have 
single-row harps. It’s not the diatonic nature of the harp, because 
European harps were also exclusively diatonic until the years shortly 
before 1600. One of the main differences between our harp and European 
harps is the metal strings and the robust body which is needed to 
support those high-tension metal strings. That’s what comes out of our 
astounding technology at such an early period, that we have amazing 
metalworking capabilities in this bit of northwest Europe going way, way
 back.</p>
<p>We apparently have Viking wire-drawing plates here, I think, that 
originate from the 800s. Ann Heymann once coordinated with the American 
historical metallurgist, Daniel Tokar, on an experiment to see if he 
could make a string without a draw plate. Because it had been posited 
that you can’t have strings before you have string draw plates, that is,
 before the 800s.</p>
<p>Tokar rolled a string rather than drawing it. Despite the idea that 
you couldn’t have consistency of gauge and it would therefore break 
relatively quickly. Ann brought it over to <em>Scoil na gCláirseach</em>
 one August, we put it on a harp, we tuned it up to pitch and there it 
remained for a long, long time. No bother, no problems. No technological
 difficulties whatsoever. First one, it worked first time. So we began 
to realise that you don’t need draw plates to produce strings, that we 
could potentially go back before the 800s for the first wire harp 
strings.</p>
<p>I think the unusual material used here – metal – has to do with our 
technology. The Irish could do very fine work in metal. But why did we 
need to make harp strings out of metal? Everywhere else in Europe used 
gut or horsehair. So why did we need or want metal strings in Ireland?</p>
<p><strong>Perhaps because we had the material here and made use of it?</strong><br>
We did. But wouldn’t you ask, if they had gut everywhere else in Europe,
 why were we not playing with gut? It is a perfectly reasonable thing to
 put on your harp. Well, except that in autumn in Ireland the gut 
strings on my Italian triple harp start to break on me. That’s the 
problem with gut in Ireland ­­– the climate is not conducive to its use 
at all. We have a really damp climate here, and gut does not like the 
damp.</p>
<p><strong>Scotland as well.</strong><br>
Exactly. I’ll give you the classic example of that. Before I moved back 
to Ireland in 1998 or thereabouts, I had all my harps in London in a 
nice, dry Victorian house. We moved back to a stone cottage that was 
built at the end of the nineteenth century, with walls that are a metre 
thick. Just stone with a slate roof. I was so thrilled to be back in 
Ireland, after many years away, that when I arrived, I took all my harps
 out of their cases and lined them up against the wall in one room 
thinking, you know, “I’m home, my harps are home, this is wonderful!”. 
When I got up the following morning I got a bit of a shock. Every single
 harp that had gut strings was trailing bunches of strings in all 
directions. They were so unhappy to go from a dry, centrally-heated 
house in London to go to an old, stone house in Carrick-on-Suir with no 
heating, which was much damper. Meanwhile, my wire-strung Ardival ‘Rose’
 harp, was just in the corner, quietly humming a tune as it were, not 
even out of tune, while the other harps were all basically committing 
suicide! So perhaps that’s the reason we have metal strings? Because our
 climate does not like gut. And you imagine a big, drafty, stone castle.
 Stone buildings tend to be damp and dank and cold and miserable and 
drafty, and gut strings won’t tolerate that.</p>
<p>So I think that’s one of the reasons we have metal strings here – 
they survive much better, and we had the technology to make them. That’s
 my guess. I don’t know for sure but that’s my practical experience of 
both kinds of strings.</p>
<p><strong>I’m wondering whether that would carry through from the 
period of medieval low-headed harp to later, high-headed harps. I’m 
thinking that horse-hair harps in Wales, or Gothic harps, didn’t survive
 that period between medieval and the sixteenth- to eighteenth century. 
They died out after the medieval period, whereas our wire-strung harp, 
it changed in height but it stood the test of time. </strong><br>
I see what you mean – that our harp evolved somewhat and kept going, and
 the Welsh harp …. I think the horse-hair-strung harp in Wales was 
somewhat superceded by the Italian triple harp, which travelled widely 
all over Europe, got as far as Wales and turned into the Welsh triple 
harp. So it was overtaken by a more versatile instrument that arrived, 
that had chromatic possibilities. Chromatic harps didn’t make as many 
inroads into Ireland.</p>
<p>But actually I’m wondering if my previous argument is unsafe, the 
argument that I just mentioned about it being the climate. Because they 
had horse-hair-strung harps in Wales and that’s not exactly a dry 
climate. So maybe it was more to do with our metalworking technology and
 less to do with our climate? I don’t know. Horse-hair-strung harps seem
 to survive okay in Wales. Or maybe they had no choice, maybe they 
didn’t have the metalworking technology available here so they had to 
make do. I don’t know enough to be able to comment knowledgeably.</p>
<p><strong>It’s really interesting. One of the reasons I was curious to 
dive more into the technology is that the early Irish harp is something 
that is right in front of us – on our coins and so on – and yet as a 
society we haven’t appreciated it as an example of highly refined, 
indigenous design. So many harp builders look at this design, take a 
quick squint at it, and say “I can do better than that”. </strong><br>
Oh yes, that’s very common – the chronocentric idea that our time is the
 most evolved, that we are the most intelligent people who have ever 
lived and that those who came before were less able than we are.</p>
<p><strong>Whereas as much knowledge could have been lost as gained.</strong><br>
Of course, there’s a complete lack of humility in front of earlier 
technologies which were sometimes spectacularly good. You look at the 
metal-working technology in The National Museum on Kildare Street, in 
Dublin – the Bronze Age exhibits. The Broighter Hoard for example. We 
ought to be a lot more humble.</p>
<p><strong>It’s like, going back to the analogy of the airplane wing, 
imagining a hypothetical scenario in which future generations have lost 
the design of the airplane, for whatever reason. If they were to 
rediscover in an archeological dig an airplane wing, they might figure 
out that it was attached to the nearby fuselage and put it back 
together, but then argue “the wing isn’t thick enough, that’s never 
going to hold up, and why is it that funny shape? We’ll just change it”.
 They might take a very long time to get off the ground. So the point 
is, there is a very good reason that soundboxes were tapered, the 
thickness that they were, and why they were so resonant as a result. 
These details are important and they are really subtle.</strong><br>
Well this for me is an integral part of the HIP argument. That when you 
try to reproduce replicas of instruments, that you do it with humility, 
and that you understand that these instruments teach us. It’s not for us
 to plaster our modern ideas onto these artifacts. You need to – with 
all humility – just try to reproduce the artifact and see what it 
teaches you. That’s an integral part of HIP, and anything else is… 
you’re not going to learn so much. Once you add your own opinions on 
top, from the word go, then you’ve lost an opportunity to learn. And as 
you say, it’s the really subtle things – that you don’t know why they’re
 there until you keep reproducing them and using them and seeing what 
they teach.</p>
<p>It’s like when people say to me “well, why would you have <em>na comhluighe</em>
 on the harp, why would you have these two unison tenor G-strings? Sure 
there’s no point!” Well I don’t know what the point is, but that doesn’t
 mean there isn’t a point. Perhaps consider being humble enough to – you
 know – do it. Reproduce it, see what it teaches you about how to place 
fingers and how to play, and all sorts of things. And that’s true of 
every aspect of reproducing these harps, every single aspect that you 
can think of. Don’t ask, don’t second-guess, just reproduce, just 
reproduce and see. Then we’ll talk!</p>
<p>So that’s why I was really keen to initiate laser scanning of early 
Irish harps. Because often harp builders will say “ah, I don’t think 
they really meant that”, and “you know, I can do this”, and “let’s tweak
 that”, from the word go. Or they simply lack accurate measurements from
 which to work. That’s why we need impeccable measurements and to be 
able to say “Use those. Don’t try to second-guess.” And don’t tell me 
that you don’t want to build it because you think it’s a bad instrument.
 That’s also not an argument I’m open to. Just build the instrument, 
then we’re in a position to discuss it and learn from it.”</p>
<p><strong>This all goes back to the idea of student instruments, and 
how it’s not just about knocking them out cheaply, that there is a lot 
more to consider. You mentioned compromises – can you talk a little more
 about what compromises can be made.</strong><br>
Well it’s always going to be a movable feast, and it’s an 
ever-disappearing target. You’ll never get to your goal. So we try 
really hard to produce accurate copies of surviving instruments, but 
they’re never going to be accurate enough, so every decade or so we seem
 to be improving. We will streamline them and hopefully they will become
 more and more accurate. So every time we produce a range it’s a 
snapshot of where the bar is now for accuracy for those instruments.</p>
<p><strong>But there are essential, or high priority things like, for example <em>na comhluighe</em>. So having <em>na comhluighe</em> is presumably a decision that is made?</strong><br>
Oh yes, there are certain things that are not negotiable. The first 
thing we throw away is all the decoration – all of that frippery – 
because you don’t need that. What you really need are accurate string 
lengths, accurate string spacing, you know accuracy of all possible 
measurements that you can get. And again it’s the thing that – until ten
 or fifteen years ago – harp builders didn’t notice that the string 
spacing was idiosyncratic on a lot of the instruments. They would all 
place the top string and the bottom string, and then would space the 
strings evenly between one and the other. So you’d have an equidistant 
spacing along the harp. And of course now when we look at the harps it’s
 really clear that the string spacing is much more anarchic. Guy 
Flockhart was the first person to build an instrument with irregular 
spacing. He built a copy of the <em>Lamont</em> harp that Javier Sáinz 
had for a long time. I think when Javier got the harp he said he was 
shocked because Guy Flockhart had faithfully copied what he saw on the 
original and nobody had ever done that before. The strings below and 
including <em>na comhluighe</em> were much closer spaced together than the others. And you can see the same feature on the <em>Trinity College</em>
 harp – the string spacing is all over the place. The strings at the top
 tend to be a bit more fanned out and then they’re wide in the middle 
and they narrow down the bottom. Nobody had ever taken that kind of 
thing seriously before, until Guy Flockhart did. So Javier was able to 
learn from that and then all the rest of us too. String spacing has 
implications for damping and other things and/or maybe we don’t yet know
 quite why it was so. But you know it’s a bit like “build it and they 
will come” – “make it so and we will learn”!</p>
<p><strong>In terms of string material and making those kind of 
decisions, there has been a lot of good work there too. Can you talk 
about this?</strong><br>
Yes, that’s changing, even as we speak, because we have new work in 
recent years by Paul Dooley and Karen Loomis. Both their PhDs touch on 
pitch standards. I think they are suggesting that the pitch standard of 
the medieval Irish harps is higher than modern pitch. So that affects 
the choice of stringing materials. Ann was the first person to suggest 
that precious metal strings could be the solution to a weak-sounding 
bass on a Trinity college harp, but of course that’s based on a premise 
of stringing at A440 – modern pitch. So it could be that with higher 
pitch, brass starts to be more plausible on medieval harps. That’s all 
work in progress, and it’s not my area of expertise, so I can’t really 
say much more about it. Ann was the first person to start working on it 
and Simon is also interested in pitch standards and stringing materials.
 We can all learn from their work.</p>
<p>For our <em>HHSI Student</em> harp series we use wire from a maker of
 harpsichord wire – Malcolm Rose. From him we were always able to source
 yellow brass and red brass. I think on our <em>HHSI Student Trinity</em>
 harps, we originally put sterling silver in the bottom since we were 
tuning them at A440. And now we’re probably going to tune them higher 
than that, so the stringing materials will need to change somewhat as 
well.</p>
<h2><strong>SINGING, SPEAKING THE SONG ON THE HARP</strong></h2>
<p>One of my biggest interests is the vocal repertoire. I was reading the other day in one of the <em>An Píobaire</em>
 newsletters a comment by Robbie Hannon, I think, who was pointing out 
that Séamus Ennis is on record as saying that for a player to perform an
 air with feeling and to have an understanding of the appropriate 
phrasing, you have to know the words of at least one verse of the song. 
And I thought “that is totally where I’m coming from”.</p>
<p><strong>When you say that’s totally where you’re coming from, is that
 your own personal feeling, or is there precedence for that in the HIP 
world, in early music?</strong><br>
Very good point. Yes there’s precedence for that in HIP performance. We talked already about <em>La Nuova Musica</em>
 – the ‘new music’ at the end of the sixteenth- and turn of the 
seventeenth century, where music went from complex polyphony with many 
lines intermingling – where maybe you couldn’t make out the words so 
well if it was vocal music – to a radical simplification in some cases 
because it’s the words, it’s the words and it’s the words! So Claudio 
Monteverdi was the one of the first composers who wanted to – and had a 
real genius for – setting speech and speech rhythms in music. It’s <em>recitative</em>
 or singing speech. The accompaniment was improvised over a given 
bass-line and you had your speech rhythms on top. As an instrumentalist 
your job is to accompany, and paint, those words.</p>
<p>So that’s what I’m most often doing when I’m outside Ireland, when 
I’m – so to speak – in my ‘other world’ of seventeenth-century European 
music. When I’m doing that, I’m generally improvising an accompaniment 
for maybe the two and a half hours of an opera, and I’m trying, as I go 
along, to express the <em>affect</em> of those words. So you know if 
it’s ‘heaven’, I’m painting a heavenly sound, if it’s ‘hell’ I’m 
hopefully making a nasty noise. So I have quite a big palette of colors 
on my baroque harp – beautiful sounds, very ugly sounds, harsh sounds, 
gorgeous big warm-bath sounds. So you should be able to produce all 
those, to paint the text that’s in front of you.</p>
<p><strong>Is that personal, or were you encouraged when you were first encountered this music to develop this way of playing?</strong><br>
The second, absolutely. You’re not just a ‘cabaret player’ in the 
background, you’re an integral part of the action on that stage. You are
 giving the singers all the colors that they need to help them paint the
 text and for the action to go forward. So that’s been embedded in me 
since my early twenties – to express the words. And all the treatises 
say “don’t worry about the vocal quality as a primary concern – don’t be
 a ‘singer’ – get the words out, get the story across”.</p>
<p>And a good <em>sean-nós</em> singer will say exactly the same thing to you. They’ll say it’s all about the words and it’s all about the story.</p>
<p><strong>Singing a song in Gaelic is <em>abair amhrán</em>.</strong><br>
Exactly! <em>Abair amhrán</em> [‘say the song’], it is not <em>seinn amhrán</em> [‘play the song’] or <em>bí ag canadh amhrán</em> [‘sing the song’], no it’s <em>abair amhrán</em>
 because it’s the words, it’s always the words ­– you know – ‘speak the 
song’. And it’s the same thing at the turn of the seventeenth century in
 European art music– speaking the words. The words are the most 
important thing. So for me – any music I’m involved in – I want to 
express the words.</p>
<p>I would take that all the way back to plainchant if I’m accompanying 
plainchant. This is something I that, my husband, John Elwes taught me. 
He was head chorister in Westminster Cathedral in London in the late 
1950s when he was a child. He was singing plainchant and polyphony for 
twenty-five hours each week, really as a professional child singer.</p>
<p>When I hear most singers nowadays singing Latin plainchant, they sing
 it in a sort of disembodied voice, as if it’s not really connected to 
the human condition at all. But when John sings plain chant, it’s quite 
different. Much more muscular – much more vivid. Westminster Cathedral 
Choir had a wonderful choir master, the famous harpsichordist, George 
Malcolm, who had a continental, Roman-Catholic approach to singing. John
 would look at plainchant on which I was working and would point out the
 possible word painting it, making me aware of that possibility in 
pre-seventeenth-century music for the first time.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example, because I think this is really quite 
important, to get the sense that it’s not something that’s stitched on 
later, that this is something that originates in the fabric of the 
music. <em>Salve Splendor</em>, from the thirteenth-century Scottish 
Inchcolm Antiphoner, composed in honour of St. Columba or Colmcille as 
we call him in Ireland.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325082816.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
[Sings]… I can’t remember the words there, but when it goes into the melisma on his name, the next line of the text is ‘<em>O Columba, O Columbine</em>’.
 So now you’re speaking the name of the saint, and this chant is in his 
honour. So it translates as ‘O dove, o little dove’. Columba / 
Columcille means ‘dove of the church’. And so the text goes ‘O Columba’ 
…[sings]… suddenly it heads up in register. ‘Columbine’ goes into this 
kind of complete ecstasy on the name of the saint. That’s word painting.
 It’s like “wow, Columba, this is our guy. We get excited when we say 
his name”, it’s like “Li-ver-pool” you know, it’s that kind of a way! So
 during the whole melisma you get loads of notes and you get this 
beautiful phrase and it goes up. That’s word painting.</p>
<p>Or even – it might be fanciful – but you have a responsary for St. 
Patrick that shows up in Trinity College MS 78, which was here at St. 
Canice’s cathedral in Kilkenny in the fifteenth century. It starts off 
‘Ductu angelico mare transiens’, which translates as ‘So by angelic 
translation he crosses the sea’.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325079474.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
Basically, it talks about St. Patrick going to Gaul because he studies with <em>Germanus</em>
 who is the Bishop of Auxerre. So it talks about crossing the sea. So 
the tune is …[sings]… I see that as kind of the lapping of the waves 
against the boat, don’t you? …[sings]… there’s the boat going off. 
That’s word painting! You know you’ll only see what you’re looking for. 
If you’re not looking for word painting in plainchant you’re never going
 to find it. But if you look for it it’s there in spades!</p>
<p>So I see the same thing in seventeenth-century Italian music, and I 
see it, I think, in Irish music, in fact I think I’d say in all music, 
if you’re playing a song you better know the song because otherwise how 
are you going to play it?<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325079138.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
The song lives and breathes on the words and the syllables and the 
poetic stresses and the metre and everything that goes with it, and if 
you don’t know any of that you’re missing 90% of your information to 
play that song.</p>
<p>Another good example – a classic example I always use for students 
when I’m introducing them to this – is the beautiful elegy that Carolan 
composes in memory of Toirdhealbhach Óg Mac Donnchadha who dies in the 
eighteenth century. Toirdhealbhach Óg was a Catholic lawyer during 
penal times when Catholics weren’t allowed to have professions so it’s 
amazing that he could practice at the bar. The words are “<em>Táim dubhcroidheach go leor, ‘s níl súgaigh i mo ghlóir, ‘s níl seans i mo gháire faoi do bhás a Thorlaigh Óig”</em> that’s how it begins…[speaks]…<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325077995.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
So “I’m black hearted, there’s no mirth in my voice, there is no 
laughter or anything, because of your death, young Turlough”. Now the 
tune – there are two versions of this tune that survive – there is one 
in Bunting and there is one in Neal [John and William Neal’s A 
Collection of The Most Celebrated Irish Tunes, Dublin 1724, the first 
ever publication of Irish music in Ireland]. And in Neal it’s in 
crotchets and quavers. It begins, let’s say for the sake of argument, on
 an [A]. So …[sings]… so that’s how most people, if they don’t know the 
song, they’re going to play …[music]… because that’s what is in the 
collection.</p>
<p>And this is my point about notation being a sort of hopeless medium –
 you cannot capture music on paper – there’s no way. And one of the 
problems is that music notation is vertical and has bar lines and it has
 notes of specific lengths and you can’t have a thing that’s a bit 
shorter than a quaver, or a bit longer than a crotchet. You have to 
commit. It’s maths. You can have something that’s that long, or it’s 
half that long, or it’s double that long. But how about if it’s like 
maybe a third more than that? You know, it’s very tricky.</p>
<p>So I would never teach somebody that tune by looking at the notes, 
because you’re sunk if you do. Then you’re always going to have 
…[music]… I mean okay if they were really musical they might go 
…[music]…<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325076262.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
but only if you sing or if you could say <em>táim dubhcroidheach go leor, táim dubhcroidheach go leor</em>
 and then sing it …[sings]… wow, that’s completely different to the dots
 on the page because now it’s not metrical anymore. You’re following the
 <em>fadas,</em> the long and the short syllables …[sings]… you wouldn’t
 sing …[sings]… I mean you as an Irish speaker you would die before you 
do that. But if you looked at the notes that’s what you’d sing unless 
you had some feeling for the Irish. Or somebody who would say the words 
for you in Irish. Once you can say the words then you have some chance 
to be able to play the words. [Music]… and let’s give it with a bass 
…[music]… I’ve got F-sharps so I can’t go on but you get the gist.</p>
<p>The poetry is the vital thing for the phrasing. If you don’t know the
 poetry and you don’t know the language and you’re not interested in the
 song, I’m not interested in hearing you play the tune. So I’m with 
Séamus Ennis. You have to know at least one verse of the song if you 
want to play the tune, to get the most out of it. Of course anybody can 
play anything, and of course it’s tricky if you don’t speak Irish or you
 don’t speak Gaelic. How on earth are you supposed to approach this 
music? Well you do the best you can. We’re all lacking something 
somewhere, so we all do the best we can. But in an ideal situation try 
and have some familiarity with the lyrics of a song, if you’re going to 
play it.</p>
<p><strong>I appreciate everything you’ve said, absolutely. And it 
really deepens it a lot, when it’s not an “us and them” situation. That 
this is an approach to music – regardless whether it is plainchant or an
 elegy composed by Carolan </strong><br>
Well, bear in mind, in my situation with my European harps, it’s me accompanying a singer.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325075837.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
But in this tradition of early Irish harping, they were singing and 
accompanying themselves. So it’s completely integral to it. It’s not 
even that they were accompanying singers – they are singing themselves. 
That’s a whole other ballgame, you know. That’s why it’s so important to
 have people like you who sing and play the instrument, because you have
 a chance of, you know, creating something amazing.</p>
<p><strong>I’m really curious – why do you do not sing more while playing?</strong><br>
Oh! Because I found better singers than me. In my twenties, when I still
 played modern Irish harp, I used to present solo programmes, and sing 
and play the harp. But, to be honest, I did a lot more <em>acapella</em>
 singing then playing harp tunes. I had a slight horror of singing with 
the harp because I was female and had red hair and was playing a harp. I
 was a living cliché! And I suppose I came from an era where Mary O’Hara
 was singing and playing with the harp, and it was a sort of slightly 
Victorian thing somehow. It wasn’t really modern and cool. And so I had a
 definite knee-jerk reaction not to sing with the harp. I only did it 
sometimes.</p>
<p>Then I married a European art-music singer who would go on to be 
nominated for a Grammy, so that really shut me up, because if you have 
world-class singing in your house you tend to just not! It sort of 
dampened me somehow – I felt an inhibition. And then when I started 
working on the vocal repertoire seriously, even though I love to sing, 
and I sing all the time, and I’m delighted to sing, I feel like I’m 
quite ‘corrupted’, if you like, by art music. I think I sound like an 
art-music singer singing an Irish song. And what I really want – I’m 
trying to get as close as I can by playing the old instruments – the 
closest I think we can get is somebody who has a really good <em>sean-nós</em> style and try to encourage them into harper vocal repertoire.</p>
<p>That’s what I’ve been doing for years, with many singers. With Bríd Ní Mhaolchiaráin, who was a guest on <em>Cláirseach na hÉireann</em>
 in 2004, and then with Róisín Elsafty, Áine Ní Dhroighneáin and Éamon Ó
 Bróithe. And now with one of my own students who is a prize-winning 
singer – Eibhilís Ní Ríordáin, who is at the HHSI summer festival this 
year. We’re working really intently on reconstructing, and putting the 
lyrics back to the tunes. How we do that and how we approach it – that’s
 what I’m interested in with people who already have good style and 
embedded knowledge in their singing. I think that’s so much more than I 
can offer.</p>
<p><strong>I’m curious to delve into this a little because we’re talking
 about the instrument and a Historically Informed Performance approach 
to early music. It’s something Ann Heymann sometimes talks about as well
 – that we all have hands, we all have fingernails, which presumably 
aren’t dramatically different to what was there since medieval times. 
The voice can be considered an early instrument if we think that it 
hasn’t changed much, to our knowledge, since medieval times. I’m 
interested in what is different when we sing and play at the same time –
 if it’s something that’s unique, not necessarily unique to Irish music,
 although we do know it was a feature of our old tradition. How 
important do you think it is to sing and play the early Irish harp?</strong><br>
Well maybe you’re right, maybe I should be doing this. Maybe I need to 
get over myself and do it a bit more. I’m just worried that my singing 
is not at the standard of my harping, that it’s not stylish enough. That
 I don’t have the <em>blas</em>, because I didn’t grow up singing <em>sean-nós</em>
 songs. I have an enormous love for it. But I’m just worried that the 
end product would be a little bit too… that it would be a sanitized 
sound that people would feel was sort of ‘parlour singing’.</p>
<p><strong>I do understand, and in fact I think many people have this feeling about <em>sean-nós</em>
 singing, including Irish speakers, including myself. I’m really lucky 
that I was guided along when I was young. I think a good teacher will be
 able to explain what goes on. A lot <em>sean-nós</em> teaching tends to
 focus on just listening – and I have a lot of time for that – though 
there aren’t that many old recordings of <em>sean-nós</em> singing. I 
mean there’s plenty from the fifties on but that’s kind of the tail end 
of an older tradition. Musicians I admire most are also able to explain 
and articulate what they are doing, and I feel that this is maybe 
lacking a bit with <em>sean-nós</em> singing. That said, there are exceptions like Éamon Ó Bróithe who are incredible at getting the nuances across to students. </strong><br>
You see he’s incredible because he has the academic skills to work with 
the language and the metre of the poetry. And he’s a singer and just an 
incredible all-rounder – he’s got so many different skill sets that are 
all wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of that ‘impostor syndrome’ around <em>sean-nós</em>
 singing, I fully acknowledge that difficulty, that there is a perceived
 barrier. There is also another barrier that can be sometimes promoted 
within the <em>sean-nós</em> singing community, that to have any chance 
of being a highly accomplished singer you need to have learned from your
 own parents or relations, by osmosis. I don’t really agree with these 
barriers. They serve no useful function, other than perhaps acting as a 
smoke-screen covering up poor teaching. I think it is possible to teach <em>sean-nós</em> singing, but that generally speaking, it has not been taught particularly well. </strong><br>
But there is that embedded knowledge thing that if you’ve heard your 
great granny and your granny and your mother all doing it, that does 
give you a huge advantage because it’s embedded. You haven’t even had to
 think about it. It’s literally gone in with the mother’s milk, you 
know.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah but that’s not to say it’s the only way. I think it’s worth recognising the barriers many feel when learning to sing in a <em>sean-nós</em>
 style. Bearing that in mind, how important is the difference between 
singing the pieces and then playing them, versus singing with the 
instrument?</strong><br>
That’s a great question. I suppose when I’m playing the piece, without a
 singer, I’m singing it inside. I’m singing the words in my head. Like 
if I’m playing <em>Toirdhealbhach Óg Mac Donnchadha</em>, inside I’m going <em>táim dubhcroidheach go leor, ‘s níl súgaigh i mo ghlóir</em> …[speaks]…<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325073666.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
and I’m just getting them out through my fingers instead of my mouth. 
The difference is if I’m accompanying somebody else, I’m at their mercy 
or at their disposal. So they’re doing it and I’m trying to fit in with 
them. That’s my job as an accompanist – just fit in with them. Whereas 
if I’m playing it myself I don’t have to – I’m just sort of fitting in 
with me.</p>
<p><strong>I think this is a huge difference. There is a whole 
association between playing the harp and being an accompanist. You’re 
talking about a very different thing.</strong><br>
Yes, you’re right. Except that in my case it’s not that some singer 
brings me a song and I have to accompany it. It’s different. I’m the one
 who finds the songs. Generally, I’m the one who figures out how the 
lyrics work with the tune, and I’m trying to work out methodologies to 
do that well. Rather than just saying “well there’s this bunch of words 
and there’s this bunch of notes – we just have to kind of shoehorn them 
together somehow”. No, I think if you look at the metre of the poetry 
you realise where the <em>fada</em>‘s are, where the strongs and the 
weaks are. We talked earlier about strongs and weaks in music – 
obviously I see those very clearly straightaway or it doesn’t take me 
long to work them out. So then there is a better sort of methodology for
 marrying them together. And I’m not saying that it always works that 
way, but for sure it’s better than just doing it in some sort of 
haphazard way that has no pattern piece to it. I generally do that 
bearing in mind that some of the singers I work with don’t read music 
well or at all. So I sing the song and I make sound files, and that’s 
how they learn the song – from me singing it.</p>
<p>Now of course they will take that song and run with it. They’ll make 
it their own, and they will pull it around. So you’re right. But it’s a 
lot closer to me singing and playing, than my just accompanying the 
singer who brings a song. That’s just not how it is in my case. It’s a 
song that I’ve resurrected and given them and hope that they’re 
interested in learning it. Then what they bring to it is wonderful. Like
 if I’m working with Róisín Elsafty, she just brings her wonderful… all 
her embedded knowledge of <em>sean-nós</em> singing. She might not even 
be aware of what she’s doing. Maybe she doesn’t even think she’s doing 
stuff with it, but six months later she will have made it her own in 
amazing ways. I see a huge value in that because then she can teach me 
things about the song that I wouldn’t have thought of myself. So you’re 
right – it is a trade-off. It would be better her singing with a harp, 
but happily I can also tie into Róisín or somebody else’s embedded 
knowledge and hopefully we can all learn from that.</p>
<p><strong>I think it’s fantastic, a really interesting process, your artistic process – that’s a fascinating way of working.</strong><br>
Well, it’s not without its moments because we argue robustly back and 
forth about the issues but usually the arguments are really productive. 
For example, Róisín brought up something recently. She said what you 
said – that it’s kind of ridiculous having the singer separate to the 
harp, because they were singing their own songs to their own 
accompaniment. So she said it’s not really historical to split up the 
two, and she’s right.</p>
<p>But then she was also wondering if they even sang in a <em>sean-nós</em>
 way. I think “well, that’s as close as we can get”, so I’m really happy
 to have somebody like her. But it’s true that there are all sorts of 
questions and conundrums around it. Particularly the Carolan songs for 
example – the range of the melody is enormous sometimes. They are not 
very comfortable to sing in that range, because many songs in the 
tradition tend to have smaller ranges. So I don’t know if that means 
that people were pushing their voices more in earlier centuries and that
 nowadays <em>sean-nós</em> singers are more like pop-singers where they
 sing in quite a small range. I can’t answer that but that’s a question 
that really needs to be answered for Carolan songs. Or maybe the harp 
versions that we have – because we know from the Bunting manuscripts – 
sometimes he writes ‘played this way’ and ‘sung this way’, and the 
playing way will be much more complex, with more notes in it. The sung 
way is a bit simpler. So it could be that maybe the gamut is a little 
bit smaller – that they’re not quite pushing down as far or up as far. 
But there are all sorts of questions to be answered. That’s a whole 
genre of music that we need lots of people researching – singers and 
historical harpists. It’s of huge interest to me.</p>
<p>There is also the question of voice type. I suspect that Carolan had 
some kind of tenor voice, that he could go up quite high, but that he’s 
singing in a quite a small room. He’s not trying to project, so he can 
go into his lower range and that’s fine and people can still hear him.</p>
<p>But there are all sorts of issues. Sometimes Róisín and I have 
arguments about how to match the lyrics with the music. We had one 
really interesting argument once about the song <em>Róis Bheag Dhubh</em>, a version of <em>Róisín Dubh</em>, and the tune is …[music]…<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325072965.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
so you have these repeated notes …[music]… so if you sing it in the key 
of A, that’s an [E] …[music]… so you’re hanging out on particular 
pitches.</p>
<p>And then if you look at the metre of the poetry, it’s <em>amhrán</em> –<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325071849.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
<em>Béidh éiclips ar na spéartha ‘gus doirtfear fuil, tuile tréana ó na 
sléibhte do stróicfeas cnoic, réabfaidh carn séadhbha is na móinteach 
uilig, nó béidh i n-aon áit sul a n-éagfaidh mo róis bheag dhubh</em><br>
So that’s four feet in a line, and <em>amhrán</em> is a bit of a mixed 
bag, it can have four lines or eight lines and there could be different 
numbers of feet in the line. But here we have a four-line stanza and 
you’ve got four feet in each line. Each one is trisyllabic – you’ve got 
three stresses …[sings]… and so on.</p>
<p>So you’ve got four feet in the line. Now when you look at the tune 
…[sings]… you’ve got four feet in that line – there are your eight 
stresses, and you have eight stresses in the poetry.<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325069877.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
So I remember Róisín was singing …[sings]… and something was rubbing me 
up the wrong way I just thought …[speaks]… and when I started looking at
 the the rhyming scheme and the poetry, it’s …[speaks]… so they’re all 
lining up, [é é á i] …[speaks]… so they all line up that way and they 
line up this way – it’s a beautiful symmetrical structure. And I thought
 “oh it’s [é é á i / é é á i]” and then you look at the music …[sings]… 
that’s even on the same pitch so it must …[sings]… so the genius who 
composed this song was absolutely thinking that the metre in the poetry 
was working with the very pitches of the tune.</p>
<p>So there’s no way we throw this bunch of words at this tune and it 
somehow comes out in the wash. No, I think there’s a lot more 
sophisticated stuff going on.</p>
<p><strong>It is quite affecting there – it is really beautiful – 
especially how you play with the vowel sounds. Can you talk about the 
emotional content and the meaning of the words?</strong><br>
Well it is completely heart-rending, but it’s built into the 
compositional structure. The ‘heart-rending-ness’ is built in, isn’t it?<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325068905.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
Because you’ve got these repeated notes …[sings]… that wailing thing 
…[sings]… so there’s a kind of wailing in that. And I think the poetic 
metre is doing that as well. “<em>Béidh éiclips ar na spéartha ‘gus doirtfear fuil”</em>,
 I mean think of the words: “there’ll be an eclipse on the sky and blood
 will be shed”, I mean these words are horrendous, really heart-rending 
stuff. And I think it’s all a package – the rhyming scheme and the 
repeated notes in the tune.</p>
<p>So in the end it was easy for me to say – because it’s not just a 
matter of opinion – take the poetic metre and rhyming scheme into 
account. You could of course sing<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325068660.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
… you’d say it’s just a matter of opinion. But it’s not a matter of 
opinion, it is embedded in this composition, it’s embedded, but you have
 to be prepared to look at the poetry, the metre, the rhyming schemes 
and the musical phrases, and then it’s not a matter of opinion. And it’s
 not that I want to be right. Now Róisín is a <em>sean-nós</em> singer 
so I would always usually give in on anything to do with the language, 
that’s her baby. But when I really thought about, I thought “oh no I can
 justify it. I’ve got layers of justification for my opinion on this. I 
really think this is so. Not least to the fact that there’s a <em>fada</em> on the é –<br>
<iframe src="|%20Mi%CC%81chea%CC%81l%20O%CC%81%20Catha%CC%81in_files/325068240.html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
it’s <em>Beidh <span style="text-decoration: underline;">éi</span>clips…</em> so you can’t sing <em>Beidh éi<span style="text-decoration: underline;">c</span>lips</em>,
 they’re never going to put a long note on a short syllable. I don’t 
think you would do that, and sure enough …[sings]… it’s all working 
together beautifully hand-in-glove. So that was a revelation to me, that
 piece. I thought “oh there’s much more to this than meets the eye”, so 
if you’re looking at the vocal music you better be looking at that 
stuff, you know.</p>
<p><strong>I’m curious about the mode of the piece, what’s the ground to it?</strong><br>
[Sings]… it’s a gapped scale isn’t it, there is no [F].<br>
<iframe src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210210214046if_/https://player.vimeo.com/video/325067577" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
There’s no sixth in the scale so you can’t tell with whether it is 
Aeolian or Dorian. It’s just some ­– you know – a ‘minor-y’ thing.</p>
<p><strong>Hearing you sing that just now, you figured out so much about
 the harmonic territory of the piece. I mean, that on its own tells you 
how important singing the pieces is.</strong><br>
Important, yes, oh but there is infinitely more. There is the whole question of modes and singing.</p>
<p><strong>I’m really curious about modes. I’d really like to come back,
 but that was my second question! The first question I had was around 
how you take what you sang there and use it to make decisions on how to 
express the feeling. The emotional content is really clear to hear. </strong><br>
I should have sung it better because I wasn’t doing it for emotional content! But you’re hearing it somehow.</p>
<p><strong>And then to understand how you go from that. You’re playing 
and you’re recognizing ‘that’ note is important because of the 
underlying structure – ‘that’ syllable. How do you take it from there – 
from your early music background, your innate knowledge of a colour 
palette?</strong><br>
I don’t know how much it’s permissible to do that in an Irish context 
because it’s not European music – it’s not seventeenth-century Italian 
music, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Right, but I think it’s completely permissible, because as you sang that you would emphasise those syllables.</strong><br>
But would you? I don’t always hear that in <em>sean-nós</em> singing and sometimes maybe it’s considered a bit vulgar to do that. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>It’s not necessarily emphasizing by dramatic changes of 
volume or by vibrato, it might just be that the vowel broadens, or it 
may be that the volume gets a bit louder or that a note lasts longer 
than it ordinarily would. </strong></p>
<p>I think you’re right on all of the above. Because if you’re singing 
in your own language you’re generally not going to make a pig’s ear of 
it!<br>
<iframe src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210210214046if_/https://player.vimeo.com/video/325066034" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
You will sing it the way you’d say it – “beidh éiclips ar na spéartha agus doirtfear fuil” …[speaks, sings]… ok, so <em>éi-clips</em>, obviously strong / weak syllables – <em>é</em>
 is strong. So if I’m singing, and if you didn’t know the song and you 
saw those repeated notes …[sings]… nice tune, not really doing anything 
for us though is it? You’ve lost all of that stuff because people will 
generally… well twentieth-century European art-music training has 
trained people out of nuance, so that musicians now tend to play notes 
more equally weighted. So those repeated notes will very quickly be 
boring …[sings]. But if you know it’s <em>éi-clips</em> and <em>spéar-tha</em>,
 so you have a strong syllable and a weak syllable, then suddenly it’s 
magic …[sings]… now without even thinking of course I gave more ‘welly’ 
to the first one and less to the second syllable. You – and anybody who 
speaks Irish – would. If you’re musical and you speak Irish you would, 
but maybe not – maybe that is my early-music training interfering and 
maybe a <em>sean-nós</em> singer wouldn’t do that at all. I don’t know. I
 could be completely wrong, but I can only approach it as I do with my 
baggage and my background.</p>
<p><strong>You used a beautiful turn of phrase when you said that Róisín
 would make her own of the song, and that idea is innately within the 
music I grew up with – that you make your own of it. Your teacher won’t 
want you parroting them after a certain stage. I’m really curious about 
how you take the next step, after almost ‘rapid prototyping’ the song by
 singing it and knowing how you’re going to play it. So how do you take 
your arrangements onwards from that stage of identifying strong and weak
 notes from the corresponding syllables, to playing equally expressively
 on the harp?</strong><br>
Well I don’t think I’m doing it in that way. I think I’m just thinking the words in my head as I play.<br>
<iframe src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210210214046if_/https://player.vimeo.com/video/325065256" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
So for <em>Toirdhealbhach Óg</em>, I’m playing …[music]… I’m not in a 
conscious way thinking “oh this note is stronger, this note is weaker, 
oh I will give this note…”. No, that’s not what’s going on at all. I’m 
just singing it, I’m always singing it in my head. And you train it up 
over years and it starts to come out through your fingers. But you have 
to have the intent. Nothing is ever going to come out through your 
fingers if it’s not in your brain.</p>
<p><strong>Could you vocalise the words as you play them?</strong><br>
[Music]…<br>
<iframe src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210210214046if_/https://player.vimeo.com/video/325063818" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
You get the idea. It has to be in your brain, and then there has to be 
long training over years, because the fingers don’t want to do that – no
 fingers want to do that. What they want to do is …[music]… that’s what 
fingers always want to do, so you have to battle with them, over many, 
many years, to get them to do your bidding. That’s the job.</p>
<p><strong>I’ve tried singing with fiddle before. It’s a real battle, at
 least until you sort of split your brain – like patting your head and 
rubbing your tummy at the same time! But at a fiddle retreat last year, 
something came together and my playing completely and utterly changed 
for a while as I sang. I was only lilting or vocalising the notes I was 
playing – it was like my conscious mind was on singing and the 
subconscious was playing, or maybe it was vice versa. But having played 
fiddle all my life without managing to sing, it was a lovely experience 
to be able to sing and play. It just felt so different, as if I was 
playing from my body rather than my head. </strong><br>
It’s important on so many levels because it affects everything to do 
with your phrasing articulation. It affects fingering, it affects the 
fact that if you sing the song you absolutely know where the phrases 
end. And then I would tend not to finger across phrases, I tend to sort 
of take a mental break. So even if I’m not singing the song I hope that 
it’s all gone into the playing, that there’s lots of the song in the 
playing – that’s what I’m trying to do, that’s my thing, the serious 
aim, always. I think those of us who sing can tell straight away, when 
somebody plays a tune, if they could sing that song or not. You know. 
You know because it’s like Technicolor versus shades of grey. It just 
is, there’s no way around it. And I don’t say that as if you shouldn’t 
play the music if you can’t sing the song – all I’m saying is if you 
play the music, really, really consider strongly learning the language, 
or learning enough of it, or at least getting somebody to speak those 
words and sing the words, to record them for you so that you have some 
chance.</p>
<p>And then of course there’s the whole thing about if you sing the song
 you have to figure out where to pitch it so that you could sing it and 
play it. That’s a whole other really interesting area to me, that we 
have these two traditional tunings, either with F-natural or F-sharp. So
 there are generally two places you can put your song and generally one 
of them will work and one of them won’t work. One of them will be too 
high or too low, and one of them will be just right. It’s like 
Goldilocks – the porridge will be just right, somewhere.</p>
<p>So that’s quite interesting, that if you draw out the parameters of 
the historical tuning and a ‘comfy’ human voice, where we can 
comfortably sing – if you draw a sort of Venn diagram, there will be the
 bit in the middle of it where that song will sit. Now you do have the 
problems that I mentioned with the Carolan songs that even when you do 
all that it’s still often partially sitting outside the ‘comfy’ 
parameters. So there’s a whole other question there.</p>
<p>But the other thing that I’ve been noticing in song – I’ve noticed it
 in a few songs so far – iis that when you have a vocal setting that 
Bunting takes from somebody and an instrumental setting that he takes 
from somebody else, like for example <em>Síle Ní Chonalláin</em>. I 
think it’s from Charles Byrne and Daniel Black he takes the vocal 
version, and then he takes a different version from Arthur O’Neill which
 is more ‘notey’ and it’s clearly an instrumental version. I didn’t 
understand the first few times I looked at these songs. In fact I 
recorded <em>Síle Ní Chonalláin</em> with Róisín on her <em>Má Bhíonn Tú Liom Bí Liom</em>
 album that she did a number years ago. I didn’t understand then. So we 
recorded the song in one place and it had to be artificially put 
together – the harp had to be retuned between the vocal version and the 
instrumental version. It was only a few years later I realised what the 
deal was. Often in these songs the instrumental version is in a 
different mode to the vocal version. And you think “what’s that, why 
wouldn’t they be in the same mode?” So you can’t play them in the same 
place. So the ‘comfy’ place for <em>Síle Ní Chonalláin</em> is in 
A-Aeolian or A-minor …[music]… So I’m speeding through just so I don’t 
waste your time. So that’s in A-Aeolian, but the instrumental version 
works in that same tuning with an [F-natural] only if you play it in 
D-Dorian …[music]…<br>
<iframe src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210210214046if_/https://player.vimeo.com/video/325062020" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
[Music]… there it is – a related tune sitting in D-Dorian. And our vocal
 version is …[music]… and I thought “oh, that’s how this works – you 
keep your tuning the same and you play the instrumental and the vocal 
versions where they sit within that tuning”. The vocal version is in 
A-Aeolian and the instrumental version is in D-Dorian. I thought “yes, 
isn’t that wonderful when you sing a song, that you can appear to 
modulate”. I think they’re really clever compositions, that the vocal 
version is in one place – you can play the instrumental version there 
and then the vocal version in a different mode deliberately, so you can 
go …[music]… So you have this whole ‘lift’ of something else, and then 
you have the vocal thing, and so it gives you contrast. So I’m wondering
 if that wasn’t a deliberate compositional ploy, that if you have 
instrumental settings of songs that are in a different mode, that that’s
 deliberate so that with one tuning you can you don’t get like 65 verses
 in A! It’s more like “oh it’s a verse in A, here’s a verse in D!” It’s 
like “oh!”.</p>
<p><strong>It reminds me of the Séamus Heaney poem <em>Postscript</em>, 
the lines “As big soft buffetings come at the car sideways, And catch 
the heart off guard and blow it open”. That’s what sprang to my mind 
when you played the instrumental in one mode and then sang it in a 
completely different mode. </strong><br>
Right it’s like “Whoa –whoa!”</p>
<p><strong>That’s the experience – it’s not a key change. I was just 
brought to a completely different emotional space, like through a 
wormhole!</strong><br>
Oh so that’s what it does. Wow – oh great!</p>
<p><strong>But that they’re related</strong><br>
Yes, that they’re related. I think that’s deliberate, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>Or like that otherworldly thing in Celtic mythology and 
probably many other cultures, where a group are out hunting on a 
mountain and see a white deer with red ears, they give chase and next 
thing the side of the mountain opens and you’re in that otherworld 
suddenly. It feels like that’s the narrative version of the musical 
feeling when you move between modes for the one piece.</strong><br>
Really? I’m thrilled! That is a beautiful poetic way of articulating 
what I was feeling, but I never articulated it as beautifully as that. 
That’s really lovely – that it takes you to another world. I just think 
“yeah it gives you a lift”, but I’m a very prosaic, practical person. 
But you’re right, it’s another world.</p>
<p><strong>It also reminds me of the Modes class you give at the <em>Scoil</em>, I think it’s the piece <em>Limerick’s Lamentation</em>, where you think in the first half the piece in a major key, and then it catches you off guard in the second part.</strong><br>
It’s the Mixolydian thing. It’s <em>Da Mihi Manum / Tabhair Dom do Lámh</em> …[sings]…<br>
<iframe src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210210214046if_/https://player.vimeo.com/video/325061637" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
… it’s like “where did that come from?” – completely blown sideways! I 
think again there’s this chronocentric thing that “we’re clever modern 
musicians – they just write these simple tunes, they didn’t really know 
what they were doing”. No, keep looking. Keep looking. There’s more in 
there than you realize, and there’s certainly, I think, there’s a whole 
world to be discovered. So that’s why I’m desperate to have singers work
 on the tunes, and to be working with singers on this, because we all 
need to be working on this together saying “okay what have you spotted, 
what have I spotted? Are we seeing trends here?”</p>
<p>There are a few other pieces I play – and I can’t think what they are
 offhand – where there’s a vocal version and an instrumental version and
 it’s clearly in a different mode. So that got me thinking that it 
wasn’t just happenstance – that it’s actually a ‘thing’. That there’s so
 much to be discovered with the singing.</p>
<p>Eibhlís Ní Ríordáin is a wonderful singer that I’m working with right now. She is a <em>sean-nós</em>
 singer and she’s also a trained European art-music musician. She is a 
piano teacher and she’s the fastest student I’ve ever had on early Irish
 harp – I’ve only ever given her about six lessons and she’s already 
singing and playing Carolan and all sorts of things. So we can have 
really good arguments! A song we were working on recently is <em>Éirigh an Lae / Dawn of Day</em>
 that O’Hampsey played. We’re working on setting that text. She has all 
her embedded knowledge and I’ll say “okay here is how I think it works”,
 and she’ll say “yes, but what about that?”. So we can banter back and 
forth because she has the Irish skills too, so it’s fantastic. So that’s
 what we need – we need singers and harpists working together.</p>
<p>I had an interesting exchange with Lilis Ó Laoire by email recently, because we were discussing Carolan’s song <em>Eleanor Plunkett</em>.
 He was chewing over the idea that the vocal range is smaller than the 
instrumental version and I thought about it but decided that I didn’t 
agree. That’s why the singers and the harpists need to be talking to 
each other because what we all think is obvious in our own sphere isn’t 
so obvious to the other side. So we need to keep exchanging information.</p>
<p><strong>What was it you discussed about <em>Eleanor Plunkett</em>?</strong>Lilis
 looked at the octave jumps that occur in the piece and, as a singer, 
thought it unrealistic. But I see those ‘unusual’ jumps in many of the 
harpers’ songs. And the gamut of <em>Eleanor Plunkett</em> is only about an octave and a fourth or an octave and a fifth. And when you look at <em>Molly Nic Ailpín</em>, <em>Síle Ní Chonalláin</em>
 and many of these songs, they’re all around that gamut. So I know it 
seems kind of extraordinary to jump by an octave, but it’s not 
unreasonable – many of them do it. If you think of <em>Molly Nic Ailpín</em> …[sings]… you know, wow, getting right up to a high point.<br>
<iframe src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210210214046if_/https://player.vimeo.com/video/325059150" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
<em>Síle…</em>? …sings… that’s getting to a high point. I see lots of them jumping around and getting to high points. So <em>Eleanor Plunkett</em>
 …[sings]… right so if you take out that octave jump …[sings]… you go 
off the bottom-end of your voice – you can’t sing that! And if you put 
it up high enough that you can sing that low note then you can’t sing 
the top bit. So there is no way of squaring that circle, so I think that
 octave is real …[sings]… it’s just a little bit up there and then it 
comes right back down …[sings]… so there’s all these ups and downs.</p>
<p>I think these harp songs have lovely contours and shifts and I think 
we just have to take it seriously. I don’t think that’s unreasonable. I 
know an octave jump would be a crazy thing in a <em>sean-nós</em> song, but bear in mind these harpers are not <em>sean-nós</em>
 singers. They’re influenced by European music. Carolan is an 
eighteenth-century musician. So it’s different to your average kind of 
Irish song and I think we just have to take that somehow seriously.</p>
<p>There are far more questions than answers at the moment, but it’s very interesting and it’s integral.<br>
<iframe src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210210214046if_/https://player.vimeo.com/video/325058544" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
Singing is integral to this early Irish harp tradition because so much 
of the music is vocal. We’ve got to be thinking about it if we’re 
serious. This is as important as getting the right instrument and 
putting the right strings on it and looking at the correct hand position
 and the historical technique. This is as important – this is a part of 
the story. You can’t ignore it. Because otherwise you’ve got the right 
instrument and everything but you still don’t have the music, because 
the music is the words.</p>
